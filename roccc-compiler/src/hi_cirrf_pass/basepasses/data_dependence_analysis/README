Array Data Dependence Computation
==================================

Assumptions
------------
1. All indices are linear expressions of loop index variables.
2. Non-linear indices are not tested and for them existence of dependence is assumed.
3. All array indices are separable and in one of ZIV (Zero Index Variable) or SIV(Single Index Variable) forms.
4. Loop bounds and array coefficients are all known and computable at compile time. 
5. Array index expressions do not contain symbolic expressions.
