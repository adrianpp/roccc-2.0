The acronym `blpp' stands for Ball-Larus path profiling, a method that
measure the frequencies of acyclic program paths taken at run time.

The HALT library document summaries the advantages of the method and
sketches our implementation of it.

Beware, however, that this implementation is new and has not been
vigorously exercised.  We include it in the current distribution because
it illustrates one way to use and extend the HALT system.
