For the purposes of ROCCC, we do not need these passes.  They are useful for generating backends, but we don't
want to deal with supporting useless passes. If you need these passes, move them up to the parent directory
and uncomment their reference in the makefile.  Some changes might need to be made to the source code to make 
lists works (see machine/substrate.h for typedef List std::list).
