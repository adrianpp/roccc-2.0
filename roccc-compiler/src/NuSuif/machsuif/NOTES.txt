    * Added MAX2 and MIN2 to replace MAX, and MIN respectively
    * Added two new opcodes: LAND, BAND to discern between logical and bitwise AND.
    * Changed Logical OR to LOR and bitwise IOR or XOR to BIOR and BXOR
    * All above were edited in suifvm/{opcodes.h,cpp, c_printer.cpp, instr.cpp, code_gen.cpp} and s2m/s2m.cpp
    * added instr_claim to add printing of instruction with assertion failure.  Makes it easier to recognize problems

    * Fixed weird problem with machine/problems.h where claim() would not print correct file and linenum if you called another
      claim() within the assertion code.  I fixed it by implementing a stack which is popped off if the assertion fails and restores
      the correct filename and linenum.
