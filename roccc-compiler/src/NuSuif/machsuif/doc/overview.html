<h2><a name=toc2>Abstract</a></h2><blockquote>

Machine SUIF is a flexible and extensible infrastructure for
constructing compiler back ends.  With it you can readily construct
and manipulate machine-level intermediate forms and emit assembly
language, binary object, or C code.  The system comes with backs ends
for the Alpha and <i>x86</i> architectures.  You can easily add new machine
targets and develop profile-driven optimizations.
<p>
Though Machine SUIF is built on top of the Stanford SUIF system
(version 2.1), the analyses and optimizations within Machine SUIF are
not SUIF specific.  By rewriting the implementation of an extensible
interface layer, you can easily port the Machine-SUIF code base to
another compilation environment.  We refer to this interface as the
Optimization Programming Interface (OPI). The OPI allows us to write
optimizations and analyses that are parameterized with respect to both
a target and an underlying environment.  We use this capability to share
optimization passes between Machine SUIF and Deco, a system for
dynamic code optimization.
<p>
This document introduces Machine SUIF, presents the overall rationale
behind its design, illustrates how one writes a parameterized pass,
and describes how to get started using the system.  It concludes with
a road map for the rest of the documentation that comes with Machine
SUIF.

<h2><a name=toc3>Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Machine SUIF is a flexible, extensible, and easily-understood
infrastructure for constructing compiler back ends.  We built Machine
SUIF with the philosophy that the ``textbook'' portions, i.e. the
optimization and analysis passes, should be coded in a way that makes
them as independent of the compiler environment and compilation
targets as possible.  By adhering to this philosophy, we are able to
distribute both a working compiler and a collection of
analyses/optimizations that can be quickly and easily inserted into a
new compilation environment.
<p>
In particular, the Machine-SUIF distribution contains a working
compiler based on the Stanford SUIF compiler infrastructure (version
2.1).  This compiler is capable of producing optimized code for machines
based on the Alpha or x86 architectures.  However, the analyses and
optimizations distributed in Machine SUIF do not directly reference
any SUIF constructs or embed constants from any target machine.
Instead, each is written using a standardized view of the underlying
compiler environment, an interface layer that we refer to as the
<em>Optimization Programming Interface</em> (OPI).
<p>
This document is an introduction to Machine SUIF.  It briefly presents
our overall design rationale, gets you started using the system, and
directs you to the rest of the infrastructure documentation.  We
assume that you are familiar with the basic concepts of SUIF 2.1;
if not, we encourage you to see the documentation on the
<a href="http://suif.stanford.edu/suif/suif2/">SUIF 2 home
page</a>.
<p>
The next section enumerates our goals for Machine SUIF and outlines
how we achieved them.  Section&nbsp;<a href="#secEnvironment">[-&gt;]</a> then describes how
to install Machine SUIF and start using it to compile programs.
Section&nbsp;<a href="#secFlow">[-&gt;]</a> provides an overview of the general flow of our
back-end compilation system and presents several example back-end
scripts.  Section&nbsp;<a href="#secNewPass">[-&gt;]</a> describes what's involved in
developing optimization passes using our OPI, while
Section&nbsp;<a href="#secExtendingOPI">[-&gt;]</a> shows you how to extend the OPI 
for new optimizations.  Section&nbsp;<a href="#secNewTargets">[-&gt;]</a>
describes the steps that you need to take in order to provide support
for a new target architecture.  Section&nbsp;<a href="#secOtherChanges">[-&gt;]</a>
discusses how you can change the structure of the Machine-SUIF
intermediate representation (IR) and how to port the optimizations to
a new environment.  Section&nbsp;<a href="#secWhereNext">[-&gt;]</a> briefly outlines where
to go next for more details.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc4>Goals</a></h2>
<p>
We designed Machine SUIF for a wide range of users.  In particular, we
support those interested in:
<p>
<ul>

<li>building new optimizations that are parameterizable with respect
to the target machine and portable across compiler environments;
<p>
<li>adding support for a new or augmented target architecture;
<p>
<li>developing a new IR, without having to rewrite
all of our optimizations.
<p>
</ul>

To adequately address the needs of these users, we developed Machine
SUIF with three primary goals in mind.  First and foremost, Machine
SUIF had to be easy to use, especially if you wanted to do something
simple, and straightforward to retarget so that we could use it in
architectural investigations.  Second, it had to support the modular
development of sophisticated optimizations.  We wanted to provide our
students and colleagues with the ability to contribute passes and
benefit from the efforts of others.  Finally, it had to built in a
manner that permitted reuse of existing optimizations directly in an
optimization environment with significantly different constraints.
Specifically, we wanted to be able to reuse optimizations built for
Machine SUIF in Deco, a project at Harvard University in <em>dynamic</em>
or <em>on-line</em> optimization.  The rest of this section explores each
of these goals in greater detail.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc5>Ease of use.</a></h5>
<p>
For those using Machine SUIF simply as a compiler,
Sections&nbsp;<a href="#secEnvironment">[-&gt;]</a> and&nbsp;<a href="#secFlow">[-&gt;]</a> of this overview
should be a sufficient introduction to the system.  
<p>
Since we designed Machine SUIF as a research compiler, we expect that
most of our users will want to add or change the system in some way.
(Hey, we're never satisfied either.)  Sections&nbsp;<a href="#secNewPass">[-&gt;]</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="#secExtendingOPI">[-&gt;]</a> should help you to develop new analysis or
optimization passes.  These sections describe how we use libraries to
ease the building of Machine SUIF passes.  These libraries, e.g., the
control-flow and data-flow analysis libraries, provide abstractions
that aid in the coding of certain kinds of optimizations.  These
sections also discuss the OPI and its support for the development of
<em>parameterized passes</em>: parameterization separates target- and
environment-specific details from the algorithms of analysis or
optimization passes.  The OPI also hides the implementation of our IR,
many details of which are uninteresting to someone simply wanting to
code a new optimization algorithm.  After reading these sections, we
encourage you to read our separate documentation on the OPI.
<p>
In Machine SUIF, the objects that hold target-specific information are
parameters to the analysis and optimization passes.  These objects,
which include both functions and data structures, reside in
target-specific libraries (or ``target libraries'' for short).  Adding
support for a new target architecture therefore simply requires you to
code a new target library or extend an existing one.  Existing
optimization passes work without change for the new library.  The only
time you need to change an existing pass is when you want to change
that pass's algorithm.  By separating algorithmic details from the
architectural details, we have made it easier, as described in
Section&nbsp;<a href="#secNewTargets">[-&gt;]</a>, to experiment with new microarchitectural
features.
<p>
Finally, we have tried to do the ``little things'' that make it easier
to use someone else's software.  
<p>
<ul>

<li>We provide extensive documentation.  In particular, we use
Norman Ramsey's <code>noweb</code> system <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibnoweb">bibnoweb</a>]</b> to produce the
majority of our hypertext and hardcopy documentation.  This
literate-programming tool lets you combine documentation and code in
the same source file.  We develop <code>noweb</code> files for our most
important header files, and we incorporate these files into documents
describing the libraries that contain them.  We use
simple code comments to document Machine-SUIF passes and library
implementation files respectively.
<p>
<li>We use short, informative naming conventions in our code.
When we use an abbreviation for a particular word, we are careful to
use the same abbreviation everywhere.  We include a glossary of our
most-common abbreviations at the end of <em>The OPI User's
Guide</em>&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibopiusr">bibopiusr</a>]</b>.
<p>
</ul>


<h5><a name=toc6>Quality of optimized code.</a></h5>
<p>
Machine SUIF is a powerful system for producing optimized code.  It is
modular, making it easy to add, remove, and rearrange passes.  We
typically develop optimization passes that focus on a single action,
such as dead code elimination.  Nearly all such passes can be inserted
at any point in the back-end flow.  Thus, the writer of an
copy-propagation pass can focus on data flow and operand rewriting and
assume that a subsequent run of the dead code elimination pass will
remove any dead code produced during copy propagation.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc7>Reuse of optimization code.</a></h5>
<p>
Our research program is interested in a wide range of techniques for
program optimization.  Our interest spans the spectrum from
traditional methods performed during compilation through hardware and
software optimization techniques performed at run time.  We would, for
example, like to use the optimizations written for Machine SUIF in an
on-line optimization system and debug/test optimizations written for
the on-line optimizer in Machine SUIF.
<p>
Machine SUIF implements one realization of the OPI.  Since the OPI
hides the implementation specifics of Machine SUIF (i.e., the
substrate), we can easily produce another realization of the OPI
appropriate for an on-line optimizer.  To ensure that the
optimizations written for Machine SUIF are usable in this on-line
optimizer, we write all of our Machine-SUIF optimizations to conform
to the OPI's specification.  In this way, Machine SUIF can be a
flexible infrastructure (with full-featured IR objects) that is easy
to extend, while an on-line optimizer can use a different
infrastructure employing light-weight IR objects for efficiency.  And
both can use the same set of optimization codes.  <em>The OPI User's
Guide</em>&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibopiusr">bibopiusr</a>]</b> discusses this issue and its implications in
greater detail.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc8>Setting Up Your Environment</a></h2>
<a name="secEnvironment"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
Machine SUIF depends on the base SUIF system, which is distributed from the
<a href="http://suif.stanford.edu/suif/suif2/index.html">Stanford SUIF 2</a>
and
<a href="http://nci.pgroup.com/">National Compiler Infrastructure</a> (NCI)
web sites.
 <b>[</b>The <b>Downloads</b> page at the NCI site currently offers some
out-of-date source files under links labeled <b>The base NCI system</b> and
<b>Conversion code between suif1 and suif2</b>.  Ignore those links!  Take
only the binary distributions of <b>The C front end</b> from the NCI site.
Take the rest of SUIF from the Stanford site.<b>]</b> 
<p>
The following discussion assumes that you are using a UNIX-based operating
system as your development platform.  It also assumes that you know how to
unpack the distributions and set up the <code>nci</code> source directories.  If
not, please first review the <code>README</code> files contained in the
distributions.  Please pay careful attention to the instructions regarding
the environment settings required to compile SUIF.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc9>Compiling Machine SUIF</a></h3>
<a name="secSetupMake"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
You should first unpack and install the base SUIF distribution.
Instructions are in <code>nci/README</code>.  The same environment variables that
you use for this step (e.g., <code>MACHINE</code>, <code>NCIHOME</code>, and
<code>COMPILER_NAME</code>) are required for compiling the Machine SUIF
distribution.
<p>
Next, unpack the Machine SUIF.  You can put it wherever you like.  Follow
the instructions in <code>README.machsuif</code> file in the root directory of the
distribution to complete the installation.  Be sure to have the
<code>MACHSUIFHOME</code> environment variable set as described there whenever you
build or rebuild part of the Machine SUIF system.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc10>Compiling with Machine SUIF</a></h3>
<a name="secSetupCompile"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
A machine-specific optimization must have access to information about
the organization and microarchitecture of the target machine.  We
encapsulate this target-specific information in target libraries
(e.g., the <code>alpha</code> library).  During optimization, the compiler
selects the appropriate target library and binds the information in
this library into the current environment by constructing a
<code>Context</code> object.  The compiler knows which library to load by
reading the library name from an annotation incorporated in each
Machine-SUIF IR file.  So all procedures that originated in a given
source file are optimized using a single, consistent set of
target-specific information.
<p>
So, how do you as a person running the compiler specify a
target library?  It is fairly simple.  Only a few of our
Machine-SUIF passes actually change the value of the <code>target_lib</code>
annotation.  Each of these passes has a command line parameter,
<code>-target_lib</code>, that allows you to specify the name of a
target library.  Alternatively, if you do not specify the
target library as a command line parameter, the compiler will
check the environment variable <code>MACHSUIF_TARGET_LIB</code>.  The command
line argument overrides the environment variable, and if neither
command line argument nor environment variable is defined, the
compiler stops with an assertion failure.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc11>Back-End Organization and Flow</a></h2>
<a name="secFlow"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
You can think of Machine SUIF as a machine-level IR, with instructions
having type <code>Instr</code>, that plays a role like that of <code>Statement</code> or
<code>Expression</code> in base SUIF.  However, the Machine-SUIF infrastructure
includes much more than just another SUIF IR; it augments SUIF with
many new libraries and passes that make it straightforward to develop
machine-specific optimizations for existing or future machine models.
<p>
For us then, the back end consists of those compiler passes that start
with the lowering of the SUIF <code>Expression</code> or <code>Statement</code> IR into
the Machine-SUIF IR and that end with a translation from the
Machine-SUIF IR into assembly, machine, or C code.  During back-end
compilation, the Machine-SUIF IR for a compiled program will
transition through at least two Machine-SUIF IR dialects.  We begin
with a brief discussion of the ideas that led us to the current IR and
then move on to define what we mean by a dialect of the Machine-SUIF
IR.  With this as background, Sections&nbsp;<a href="#secGeneralFlow">[-&gt;]</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="#secCompilationSpecifics">[-&gt;]</a> describe the general flow of a
Machine-SUIF back end in more detail. This section ends with some
example back-end scripts and a word about the constraints on pass
orderings.
<p>
<h3><a name=toc12>IR organization</a></h3>
<p>
Research on machine-specific compile-time optimizations is closely
tied to research in computer architecture.  To support this area of
research, a compilation system must possess an IR that is both
extensible and expressive.  We require extensibility so that we can
experiment with new compiler-visible instructions, architectural
features, and hardware mechanisms.  SUIF was built with extensibility
as a primary design goal, and thus it has been fairly simple for us to
meet this requirement.  We desire expressiveness in our IR so that
every single machine instruction is representable by a single IR
instruction.  A one-to-one correspondence between IR instructions and
actual machine instructions is required for optimizations such as
global instruction scheduling.
<p>
The development of an extensible and expressive IR could be a lifelong
project within itself.  As mentioned earlier, we would like to avoid
actually spending our lives re-coding compiler passes every time we
make a small change to the IR.  To avoid this problem, we have defined
OPI functions that create, inspect, and manipulate IR objects in a
target-machine-specific manner.  The OPI hides the details of the IR
implementation.  In other words, the OPI supports the needs of the
optimization writer without revealing the actual structure of the IR.
The Deco project, for example, takes advantage of this capability to
use the existing Machine-SUIF analysis and optimization code with a
completely new IR.
<p>
<h3><a name=toc13>Dialects</a></h3>
<p>
Even though Machine SUIF supports optimization targeting many
different machines, all Machine-SUIF IR files have the same binary
representation.  We simply interpret the contents of this IR file
differently for each different target.  We say that each
target library defines a <em>dialect</em> of the Machine-SUIF IR.
<p>
Machine SUIF has one distinguished dialect called <code>suifvm</code>, which
stands for SUIF virtual machine. This dialect is the target of the
Machine-SUIF lowering pass.  This pass lowers from SUIF
<code>Expression</code> and <code>Statement</code> form into <code>suifvm</code> instruction form.
All the code generators within Machine SUIF are code generators from
<code>suifvm</code> to some specific target architecture.  By defining this
dialect, we are able to de-couple extensions made to base SUIF from
Machine SUIF's provision of multiple target-specific back ends.  If an
extender of base SUIF wishes to connect to Machine SUIF, he or she
need only write a lowering pass to <code>suifvm</code> . If someone wants to
add a new target to Machine SUIF, he or she need only develop a new
target library for Machine SUIF.  The base SUIF extender and the new
target developer do not need to know about each other's work.
<p>
Currently, dialects differ only in their interpretation of the integer
opcode value stored in the <code>Instr</code> structure.  The opcode
value is the key into many of the target-specific data tables, and
thus it must be interpreted correctly in order to access the
appropriate machine-specific information needed for optimization.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc14>General flow</a></h3>
<a name="secGeneralFlow"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
We considered two basic approaches that satisfy the goal of a
one-to-one correspondence between IR instructions and machine
instructions.  The approaches differ in where they perform code
generation, the actual mapping from an IR opcode to a machine opcode.
<p>
The first approach postpones this mapping until the last possible
moment in the compilation process (see Figure 1a).  To ensure that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the IR and machine
instructions, there is an earlier pass in the compilation process that
restricts the IR form so that each IR instruction can be mapped
directly to a single machine instruction.  The machine-specific
optimization passes maintain this one-to-one correspondence.  The
IMPACT compiler <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibimpact">bibimpact</a>]</b> uses an approach like this.
<p>
<hr>
<table><!-- alignment is c--><!-- 1 columns--><tr><td align=center>.c <i>--&gt;</i> front-end <i>--&gt;</i> IR-restriction <i>--&gt;</i> optimizations <i>--&gt;</i> code-gen <i>--&gt;</i> .s </td></tr>

</table>
<a name="figCgm"><b>[*]</b></a>
<b>Two approaches that satisfy the goal of a one-to-one
correspondence between IR and machine instructions.  The first splits
the code generation into two pieces.  The second relies on either
retargetable compiler technology to facilitate the quick creation of
machine-specific optimization passes or abstraction to eliminate the
need to re-code each optimization for each architecture.</b>
<hr>
<p>
The second approach performs the mapping from IR instructions to
machine instructions early in the compilation process (see Figure 1b).
Machine SUIF employs this approach.  The parameterization of our
optimization passes keeps us from having to re-implement each of our
machine-specific optimizations for each target architecture.  This
same idea is found in retargetable compilers, such as the vpcc/vpo
compiler <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibvpo">bibvpo</a>]</b>, based on compiler compiler technology.  Our
approach simply performs target specialization of the compiler
dynamically rather than statically.  We find this late binding of
target-specific information useful for environments where the target
description and compiler requirements change frequently.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc15>Compilation specifics</a></h3>
<a name="secCompilationSpecifics"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
We now describe how to use SUIF and Machine SUIF to compile a C program
to Digital Alpha/UNIX assembly code.  Begin by reading the
<a href="http://suif.stanford.edu/suif/suif2/doc/howtocompile.html">directions</a>
in the SUIF documentation that describe how to produce a <code>.suif</code> file
from a C input file.  Next, apply <code>SUIF</code> transformations that make an
IR file acceptable for lowering into Machine SUIF.  If your file is
named <code>hello.suif</code>, for example, the following command produces a
lowered SUIF version called <code>hello.lsf</code> in which some structured forms
like loops and conditional statements have been replaced by less
structured equivalents:
<p>
<pre>
    suifdriver -e &quot;require basicnodes; \
                   require suifnodes; \
                   require cfenodes; \
                   load hello.suif; \
                   require transforms; \
                   dismantle_field_access_expressions; \
                   dismantle_structured_returns; \
                   compact_multi_way_branch_statements; \
                   dismantle_scope_statements; \
                   dismantle_ifs_and_loops; \
                   flatten_statement_lists; \
                   rename_colliding_symbols; \
                   insert_struct_padding; \
                   insert_struct_final_padding; \
                   save hello.lsf&quot;
</pre>

A corresponding script, called <code>do_lower</code>, comes with the Machine SUIF
distribution.  So instead of typing the bulky command above, you can
write:
<p>
<pre>
    do_lower hello.suif hello.lsf
</pre>



<h5><a name=toc16>A minimal back end.</a></h5>
A back end starts with a lowering pass; the lowering pass that accepts
the output of <code>do_lower</code> is called <code>s2m</code>.  The output of
<code>s2m</code> is a Machine-SUIF IR file that targets <code>suifvm</code>.  We supply a
target library for <code>suifvm</code> that allows you to run
optimization passes on a Machine-SUIF IR file of this dialect.
<p>
Typically, you'll want to translate the <code>suifvm</code> code into code for a
real machine target.  This translation requires two basic steps:
translate <code>suifvm</code> instructions into the real machine's instructions
(code generation); and translate the <code>suifvm</code> symbol and
virtual-register operands into machine registers and memory locations
(register allocation).  A minimal Machine-SUIF back end consists of four
steps related to these two basic steps: perform most of the code
generation; allocate registers; finish machine-specific translation; and
emit the ASCII representation of the Machine-SUIF IR file.  The
following commands carry out these steps to generate an Alpha assembly
file:
<p>
<pre>
    do_s2m    $f.lsf $f.svm
    do_gen    -target_lib alpha $f.svm $f.avr
    do_il2cfg $f.avr $f.afg
    do_raga   $f.afg $f.ara
    do_cfg2il $f.ara $f.ail
    do_fin    $f.ail $f.asa
    do_m2a    $f.asa $f.s
</pre>

The <code>gen</code> pass (called <code>do_gen</code> when run from the shell) does most
of the machine-specific code generation.  It does not allocate
registers (beyond those necessary, for example, because a certain
instruction uses a specific, implicit register).  Since <code>gen</code>
translates from one Machine-SUIF dialect to another (i.e., from
<code>suifvm</code> to <code>alpha</code> in this case), we need to supply the name of
the target library.  Here, we used the command-line option method,
though we could easily have set the appropriate environment variable
instead.  To generate code for a different target, you simply provide
a different library name.
<p>
The <code>il2cfg</code> pass transforms the IR from simple instruction-list form to
CFG form, which is a prerequisite for most optimization passes.
 <b>[</b>In particular, the <code>dce</code>, <code>raga</code> and <code>peep</code> passes expect
their input in CFG form.<b>]</b> 
<p>
The <code>raga</code> pass performs register allocation using an algorithm
described by George and Appel <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibraga">bibraga</a>]</b>.  The <code>fin</code> pass
completes the translation process by laying out the stack frame for each
procedure, replacing stack-allocated symbols by their stack-based
effective addresses, and inserting the procedure entry and exit code
sequences.  These entry/exit sequences are delayed until this
finalization pass so that other Machine-SUIF passes can easily
reallocate registers in a procedure, for example, and not have to change
the register save/restore code at that procedure's entry/exit points.
Neither of these passes changes the target associated with the file
being compiled.
<p>
The <code>cfg2il</code> pass reverses the transformation made by <code>il2cfg</code>: it
takes in the CFG form and produces the simple instruction-list form of the
IR.
<p>
The <code>m2a</code> pass translates the Machine-SUIF representation for a
program into an architecture-specific ASCII assembly-language file (a
<code>.s</code> file).  This pass also creates the data directives for the file
by translating its symbol table.  Before this point, it is expected that
all Machine-SUIF passes maintain the symbol table (and don't create
machine-specific data directives in instruction lists).  The resulting
<code>.s</code> file can then be assembled by the target machine's assembler to
create a <code>.o</code> file.
<p>
The value of using a separate shell command (<code>do_...</code>) for each pass and
sending intermediate results through the file system is that it gives you
finer control when debugging.  However, you can also pass intermediate
results in memory, which is considerably faster:
<p>
<pre>
    suifdriver -e \
      &quot;require cfenodes; \
       load $f.lsf; \
       require s2m;    s2m; \
       require gen;    gen -target_lib alpha; \
       require il2cfg; il2cfg; \
       require raga;   raga; \
       require cfg2il; cfg2il; \
       require fin;    fin; \
       require m2a;    m2a $f.s&quot;
</pre>



<h5><a name=toc17>A fancier back end.</a></h5>
The code produced by the minimal back end described above will be highly
unoptimized.  To improve the output-code quality, you can run
machine-specific optimization passes between <code>s2m</code> and <code>m2a</code>.  For
example, you may wish to run a dead-code elimination pass <code>dce</code> to
eliminate useless operations:
<p>
<pre>
    suifdriver -e \
      &quot;require cfenodes; \
       load $f.lsf; \
       require s2m;    s2m; \
       require il2cfg; il2cfg; \
       require dce;    dce; \
       require cfg2il; cfg2il; \
       require gen;    gen -target_lib alpha; \
                       il2cfg; \
       require raga;   raga; \
                       dce; \
                       cfg2il; \
       require fin;    fin; \
       require m2a;    m2a $f.s&quot;
</pre>

This back end invokes <code>dce</code> twice: once before code generation and once
after register allocation.  This illustrates the power of parameterized
optimizations; the same pass works for all Machine-SUIF dialects.
<p>
The <code>src/machsuif/README.machsuif</code> file included with your
distribution of Machine SUIF describes the optimization passes available.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc18>Viewing the results of intermediate stages.</a></h5>
A script called <code>do_print</code> distributed with Machine SUIF allows you to
print the contents of an intermediate file in a form resembling assembly
language, even if it is not actually ready for assembly.  Suppose for
example that you want to look at the output of the code-generation stage.
If the intermediate file is called <code>hello.avr</code>, then
<p>
<pre>
    do_print hello.avr hello.avr.txt
</pre>

produces a text file <code>hello.avr.txt</code> expressing instructions in assembler
syntax.  Since the IR has yet to undergo register allocation, the listing
contains virtual registers (e.g., <code>$vr42</code>) and also symbols used where
the assembler would expect proper machine-register designators.
<p>
If you omit the second file name on the <code>do_print</code> command line, the
listing is sent to standard output.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc19>A back end that produces C.</a></h5>
Sometimes you may prefer to generate C rather than assembly language.  This
can be useful for developing a back end when the target is not available or
for testing the output of one pass without first having to transform it
through other passes.  The <code>m2c</code> pass translates Machine-SUIF
intermediate form into equivalent C code.  For example, a good way to test
the result of performing copy propagation at the <code>suifvm</code> level would be
to use the following simple back end:
<p>
<pre>
    do_s2m $f.lsf $f.svm
    do_dce $f.svm $f.scp
    do_m2c $f.scp $f.scp.c
</pre>


<h3><a name=toc20>Constraints on pass orderings</a></h3>
<p>
Consistent with the SUIF philosophy, we have attempted to minimize
restrictions on the ordering of Machine-SUIF passes.  There are,
however, certain constraints that must be met.  For example, you must
run <code>s2m</code> before any other Machine-SUIF pass.  You must run <code>gen</code>
before you run a register allocator, and you must run <code>fin</code> after both
of these.  Finally, you cannot run a base-SUIF pass on a Machine-SUIF IR
file.
<p>
Again, please see the <code>src/machsuif/README.machine</code> file included with
your distribution of Machine SUIF for information about the ordering
constraints of the passes included in that distribution.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc21>Developing a New Optimization Pass</a></h2>
<a name="secNewPass"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
One of Machine SUIF's key roles is to provide a programming interface,
the OPI, for use in writing machine-level compiler optimizations.  The
OPI is not a compiler substrate like the SUIF compiler.  It is
designed to be implemented on top of a compiler substrate, and it
relies on the substrate to take care of things like file I/O and the
pipelining of passes.  The OPI segregates the specification of
optimization algorithms from the specifics of the infrastructure
substrate that they happen to run on.  Though you can directly
manipulate the SUIF or Machine-SUIF IR, we recommend that you adhere
to the OPI so that your efforts are usable by others.
<p>
The OPI includes data structures for implementing a low-level IR,
e.g. instruction lists, instructions, operands, annotations, CFGs,
etc.  It defines functions for creating, inspecting, and manipulating
these IR objects.  The OPI relies heavily on plain old functions.
This approach is efficient, it is easy to extend, and it leaves us
able to revise major aspects of the implementation, should we need to,
without disturbing optimization passes that already exist.  The OPI
also defines data structures for describing target-machine
characteristics (e.g. the target machine's register file)
and access functions for these data structures.
<p>
Often, the best way to create a new pass is to start with an existing
one and reshape it.  The <code>peep</code> pass distributed with Machine SUIF is
a useful model.  It illustrates how a pass is structured and how to use
the control- and data-flow libraries.  We also encourage you to look
at <em>The Machine-SUIF Cookbook</em>&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibcookbook">bibcookbook</a>]</b>.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc22>Pass structure.</a></h5>
<p>
A pass consists of two pieces: a substrate-independent piece that
performs the actual analysis or optimization; and a substrate-specific
wrapper that allows the substrate-independent piece to be called as a
pass of the current compiler substrate.  
<p>
We build each substrate-independent analysis or optimization pass as a
stand-alone class.  For example, the <code>peep</code> pass defines a class
called <code>Peep</code> in the file <code>peep/peep.h</code>.  This class, like our
other substrate-independent pass classes, provides three basic
methods: <code>do_opt_unit</code> which performs the actual peephole
optimization on the specified optimization unit; <code>initialize</code> which
allow us to write code that should run before calls to
<code>do_opt_unit</code>; and <code>finalize</code> which contains code to be run after
calls to <code>do_opt_unit</code>.  Our current implementation of <code>Peep</code> uses
<code>initialize</code> to clear some statistics-gathering variables that are
printed in <code>finalize</code>.
<p>
The implementation of <code>peep</code> uses several Machine-SUIF libraries
that contain valuable tools for optimization writers.  For example, we
provide libraries for building control-flow graphs (CFG), performing
control-flow analysis (CFA), and gathering bit-vector-based data-flow
analysis (BVD).  Like the optimization passes, these libraries are
parameterized (i.e., are target independent).  You can find their
documentation in the <code>src/machsuif/doc</code> directory.  In particular,
the <code>peep</code> pass uses the CFG and BVD libraries to collect liveness
information.  The CFA library is used when dominator analysis is
needed, as in conversion to static-single-assignment form.
<p>
The code for the substrate-specific wrapper is contained in
<code>suif_main.cpp</code>, <code>suif_pass.h</code>, and <code>suif_pass.cpp</code>.  The file
<code>suif_main.cpp</code> allows us to build the stand-alone program called
<code>do_peep</code>.  The <code>PeepSuifPass</code> class in <code>peep/suif_pass.h</code> wraps
a <code>Peep</code> object in a subclass of SUIF's <code>PipelinablePass</code> class.
This allows us to invoke <code>peep</code> as a pass in the SUIF compiler
system.  SUIF provides such classes as <code>PipelinablePass</code> to capture
the boilerplate of processing command lines, reading and writing
intermediate files, and sequencing through the procedures in each
file.  The methods of these classes are hooks on which to hang
processing at strategic stages: before each file, before each
procedure, and so on.  The file <code>suif_pass.cpp</code> illustrates how we
connect the sequencing methods in a SUIF <code>PipelinablePass</code> with
those in <code>Peep</code>.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc23>Binding the OPI and focusing the environment.</a></h5>
<p>
To access facts about the target machine, each parameterized pass must
create a <code>Context</code> object and install it into the global
environment.  Installation of the <code>Context</code> object binds the OPI to
that particular target.  We perform this binding in <code>suif_pass.cpp</code>
during the processing of each SUIF <code>FileBlock</code>.  Please note that
this binding mechanism is particular to our current implementation of
Machine SUIF; binding may occur in a different manner in other
substrates.
<p>
We assume that all of the code within one input SUIF file corresponds
to a single target, and we annotate each SUIF <code>FileBlock</code> with a
Machine-SUIF <code>target_lib</code> annotation.  This annotation specifies the
target library with which to bind the OPI.  If you look at the code in
<code>do_file_block</code> in <code>suif_pass.cpp</code>, you see that we call the
Machine-SUIF library function <code>focus(FileBlock*)</code> to inform the OPI
implementation that we're now working within this <code>FileBlock</code>.  This
call also establishes the global <code>Context</code> object based on the
target library string specified in the <code>target_lib</code> annotation on
<code>the_file_block</code>.  This code also appears below:
<p>
<pre>
    focus(the_file_block);
</pre>


In addition to the focus call in <code>do_file_block</code>, we also make
a focus call in <code>do_procedure_definition</code>.
This call informs the OPI implementation of the specific procedure
definition involved in the upcoming <code>do_opt_unit</code> call.
Notice that in Machine SUIF's implementation of the OPI, an
<code>OptUnit</code> is a <code>ProcedureDefinition</code>.  We end
<code>do_procedure_definition</code> with a call to
<code>defocus</code>, which informs the OPI that the
scope has moved back to the file level.  The contents of
<code>do_procedure_definition</code> in <code>suif_pass.cpp</code> are listed below:
<p>
<pre>
     focus(the_proc_definition);
     peep.do_opt_unit(the_proc_definition);
     defocus(the_proc_definition);
</pre>

In summary, once you have indicated how the OPI should be ``bound''
and ``focused'', you are able to use functions like <code>is_move</code> and
<code>target_regs</code>.  They will work as expected for the current target.
The <code>is_move</code> function provides a way for a parameterized
copy-propagation algorithm, for example, to recognize register-move
instructions in the target ISA.  The <code>target_regs</code> object summarizes
the hardware configuration of and software conventions for the current
target's register set.  For more information about the OPI, its setup,
and its functions, please see <em>The OPI User's Guide</em> <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibopiusr">bibopiusr</a>]</b>.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc24>Extending the OPI</a></h2>
<a name="secExtendingOPI"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
The OPI is comprised of two kinds of libraries: <em>interface</em>
libraries and <em>implementation</em> libraries.  The target
libraries are all implementation libraries: those that implement
the OPI functions for a single, particular machine target.
Section&nbsp;<a href="#secNewTargets">[-&gt;]</a> describes how to augment these kinds of
libraries.  In this section, we describe two ways in which you might
extend the OPI by adding new functionality to the interface.
Obviously, this functionality would be useful only if one or more
target libraries define implementations for the new interface
declarations.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc25>Adding new functions.</a></h5>
<p>
Suppose you wish to develop optimizations that take advantage of
prefetch instructions.  In such a case, you probably want to be able
to ask if an instruction is a prefetch instruction or not.  Analogous
to the existing <code>is_move</code> function in the OPI, you create a new
interface library (let's call it the <code>prefetch</code> library) that
contains a declaration for a Boolean function <code>is_prefetch</code> that
takes a single argument of type <code>Instr*</code>.  Your optimization pass
then simply links the new prefetch library to get access to this new
<code>is_prefetch</code> function.  It is straightforward to extend this
example to add more sophisticated kinds of functions or objects.  We
encourage you to look at the machinery for existing functions such as
<code>is_move</code> (an instruction predicate), <code>type_addr</code> (which yields
the address data type for a target), or <code>target_regs</code> (which
produces an object that describes a target machine's register files).
We encourage you to develop analogous machinery for the functions and
objects you want to support.
<p>
Notice that the inclusion of prefetch instructions in an architecture
would probably cause you to want to change the implementation of the
<code>reads_memory</code> OPI function, since prefetch instructions read
memory, and the <code>reads_memory</code> predicate identifies such instructions.
When developing the <code>prefetch</code> library however, you add only
new functionality.  You change the implementation of existing
functionality, such as the <code>reads_memory</code> function, only in the
target libraries, as explained in the next section.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc26>Extending the IR</a></h5> 
<p>
The <code>prefetch</code> example requires adding a new opcode identifier and
extending some target-specific internal tables (e.g., the table
mapping an opcode to the corresponding ASCII string), but it does not
require changing the underlying IR.  You may wish however to optimize
a target ISA that has an addressing mode not covered by those built
into Machine SUIF.  You could create a new kind of address-expression
operand by defining a new subclass of the <code>Opnd</code> class and by
providing methods (analogous to those for other such subclasses)
that compose and decompose your new address expression, that
distinguish them from other operands, and so on.  In target libraries
where your new operand kind is relevant, you need to accommodate it
where target-specific treatment is appropriate.  For example, you
arrange to emit such operands in the ASCII form that the assembler
expects to see.  Again, note that you don't need to modify anything in
the existing <code>machine</code> library to add a new kind of address
expression.
<p>
You should read <em>The Extender's Guide</em>&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibext">bibext</a>]</b>.
There you will find instructions for making common extensions such as
the ones just mentioned.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc27>Adding Support for New Targets</a></h2>
<a name="secNewTargets"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
<h5><a name=toc28>A new target architecture.</a></h5>
<p>
You add support for a new target by creating a new target
library.  Here again, the best approach is probably to start from one
of the existing libraries, such as the <code>alpha</code> library, and simply
edit the implementations.
<p>
As mentioned above, a target library defines and creates a <code>Context</code>
object, which provides the OPI functions with the means to act in a
target-specific manner.  The details of how we exactly accomplish this
are interesting but not relevant to the current overview.  It suffices
to say that for each OPI function (e.g., <code>is_move</code>), you code a
corresponding <code>Context</code>-member function.
<p>
For data structures that hold target-specific properties, such as
opcode names and register-file descriptions, you write straightforward
object-initialization code.  These structures are declared in an
interface library, and they are referenced through functions declared
in those
interface libraries.  Whenever possible, you should use OPI functions
in your code within the target library.  In this way, others
can benefit from your efforts as explained below.
<p>
The OPI documentation&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibopiusr">bibopiusr</a>]</b><b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibext">bibext</a>]</b> and the
<code>machine</code> library documentation&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibmachine">bibmachine</a>]</b> provide more
detailed rationale for the contents of a target library.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc29>A new variant of an existing target architecture.</a></h5>
<p>
If you only want to specialize the description of an existing target
by adding or changing characteristics of an existing implementation,
then you should just supplement an existing target library.
Machine SUIF relies on object-oriented techniques that make it easy to
combine and refine the <code>Context</code> objects from existing libraries.
<p>
As an example, let's return to our previous discussion of adding
support for prefetch instructions to Machine SUIF.  Assume that your
original <code>alpha</code> library does not contain prefetch instructions and
that you wish to do the minimal amount of work necessary to create a
target library called <code>alpha_pf</code>.  This new library should
be functionally identical to the <code>alpha</code> library except that it
should also support Alpha architectures that contain prefetch
instructions.
<p>
Within Machine SUIF, you are able to reuse the existing functionality
from the <code>alpha</code> library that is appropriate for the <code>alpha_pf</code>
library and override the functionality that needs to change (e.g., the
implementation of the <code>reads_memory</code> function).  You would also
implement any new functionality unique to <code>alpha_pf</code> (e.g., the
<code>is_prefetch</code> function).
<p>
Not only can you do this with minimal effort, but you also do this
without having to alter the distributed Machine-SUIF libraries in any
way.  <em>The Extender's Guide</em>&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibext">bibext</a>]</b> contains
further details and examples.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc30>A new kind of machine instruction.</a></h5>
<p>
To this point, our running prefetch example has only discussed how the
system can support optimizations and analyses that are cognizant of
prefetch instructions.  Here, we say a few words about how the
front-end might indicate to the back end that the back end should in
fact instantiate and use a prefetch instruction at a particular point
in the code.  
<p>
Suppose that the pass that determines when and where to use a
prefetch instruction is a base SUIF pass, and that you have already
extended SUIF with a <code>PrefetchExpression</code>.  You want this expression
node to compile to the appropriate prefetch instruction for the
targets of interest, and simply to be ignored for other targets.
There is a <code>suifvm</code> instruction (with opcode <code>ANY</code>) for
handling extensions of this kind.  You would write an alternative
lowering pass, either by replacing or by extending <code>s2m</code>, and you
would have it translate each <code>PrefetchExpression</code> to a
suitably-annotated <code>ANY</code> instruction in the <code>suifvm</code> dialect.
The <code>instr_opcode</code> annotation of this generic <code>suifvm</code> instruction
identifies it to target-specific code generators as a prefetch
instruction; its operand sequences carry the necessary operands in the
usual way.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc31>More Radical Changes</a></h2>
<a name="secOtherChanges"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
Machine SUIF is a research compiler, and we don't claim to always know
what's best.  As such, we have made it possible for you to make fairly
radical changes to the code base that we distribute.  In particular,
it is fairly easy to replace the implementation of our Machine-SUIF IR
with a completely different implementation.  It is also fairly easy to
replace the underlying SUIF compiler environment with your own
favorite compiler environment.  The
<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/machsuif/research/deco.html">Deco
project</a> at Harvard University in fact implements both of these
changes.
<p>
Exactly what do we mean by ``fairly easy''?  We mean that you need
only make changes to the code in the <code>machine</code> library; none of the
code in the optimization passes nor the code in the target libraries
(e.g., the <code>alpha</code> library) needs to change.  The only pieces of the
interface libraries (e.g., the <code>cfg</code> library) that would have to
change are those pieces that extend the underlying IR.  All of those
are cleanly separated in each library.
<p>
As long as you adhere to the OPI, it insulates the bulk of the
back-end passes and libraries from the structure of the actual IR and
specifics of the underlying compiler environment.  Generally speaking,
we have parameterized all of our code with respect to the compiler
environment; the ``values'' of these parameters are bound when you
compile the optimization code base with a particular <code>machine</code>
library.  We have also parameterized our code with respect to the
compilation target machine; the ``values'' of these parameters are
bound when you use Machine SUIF to compile an application.
<p>
For further information, please refer to the Machine-SUIF documents
describing the <code>machine</code> and <code>cfg</code> libraries.

Machine-SUIF IR and the other key structures in Machine SUIF.  It also
describes classes that underlie some of the basic Machine-SUIF passes,
including code finalization and code output (both in assembly language
and in C).  Finally, it describes a number of utilities that are
provided by the <code>machine</code> library and widely used in the rest of the
Machine-SUIF system.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/machsuif/software/nci/suifvm.html">The SUIFvm Library of Machine SUIF</a>.

Describes the <code>suifvm</code> dialect, an idealized machine language not unlike
the ``low SUIF'' dialect of SUIF version 1.  This is the target language
for lowering passes, and the source language for generators of real machine
code.  The class <code>CodeGen</code>, which is the foundation for the system's
current concrete code-generation facilities is described here as well.
This is the one library in our system that contains both extensions to the
