<h2><a name=toc3>Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
The optimization programming interface (OPI) is a set of standardized
data structures (that represent the code being optimized and the
characteristics of the compilation target) and functions (that create,
inspect, and manipulate those data structures).  It allows you to
express machine-dependent optimization algorithms in a readable and
reusable form.  By eliminating specific references to the underlying
compilation system (called the <em>substrate</em>) and current
compilation target, optimizations based on the OPI are easy to
re-target and port.  This document describes the structure of the OPI
with respect to the libraries that implement it, and it serves as a
reference manual for those interested in extending the OPI.
<p>
The OPI is not a complete compilation infrastructure.  It is designed
to be implemented on a substrate that takes care of things like
intermediate-file I/O and pipelining of compiler passes.  Its role is
to segregate algorithms from the details of the current substrate on
which they happen to run and machine to which they happen to target.
<p>
We assume that you have read the document entitled ``A User's Guide to
the Optimization Programming Interface'' and are familiar with purpose
of the data structures and functions described there.  When extending
the OPI, we ask that you follow the concise and consistent naming
convention presented in that document so that the algorithms written
using your OPI extensions are easy to understand, maintain, and debug.
<p>
In general, we extend the OPI by adding new functions based on the
existing OPI data types or by adding new OPI data types and a few key
associated functions.  As this document illustrates, we often extend
the OPI in a carefully choreographed manner so that we do not disturb
or have to recompile the existing code base.  You simply build new
dynamically linked libraries that implement the new functionality.  In
this manner, we can distribute to you new implementations of our
source directories and not cause you to have to re-implement any of
your extension code.
<p>
Though the OPI hides the details of the underlying substrate, a person
interested in extending the OPI often has to know something about the
substrate.  Whenever possible, we have tried to define extension
mechanisms that limit your exposure to the substrate.  We also, as you
will see in this document, use our extension mechanism in defining
several parts of our Machine-SUIF implementation of the OPI.  We don't
think it is fair to ask you to use an extension mechanism if we
aren't willing to use it ourselves.  If you are using a different
implementation of the OPI, you will want to adapt these examples
accordingly.
<p>
The rest of this document is organized as follows:
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-structure">[-&gt;]</a> presents the overall structure of the code
base implementing the OPI and describes how this code base is split
into a hierarchy of libraries.
Sections&nbsp;<a href="#sec-newopnd">[-&gt;]</a>-<a href="#sec-newexobj">[-&gt;]</a> describe example
extensions associated with several different IR objects.  Whenever we
extend the OPI, we can classify that extension as <em>dependent</em> or
<em>independent</em> of the compilation target.
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-contexts">[-&gt;]</a> discusses the development of a new target
library and the concept of target-specific contexts.
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-x86-ppro">[-&gt;]</a> shows you how you can use contexts to
extend an existing target library while adding and overriding only
those target-specific functions that are new or changed.  We conclude
in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-summary">[-&gt;]</a>.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc4>Structure of the OPI</a></h2>
<a name="sec-structure"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
The OPI consists of data structures built directly on top of substrate
data structures and data structures implementing functionality not
available in the substrate.  You manipulate these data structures
using class methods or plain old functions.  For the purposes of
adding new functionality to the OPI, you simply define a new base
class or function in what we refer to as an <em>interface</em> library.
The Machine-SUIF Machine, Control Flow Graph, and Bit-Vector Dataflow
libraries are examples of interface libraries.  Analysis and
optimization passes based on the OPI refer only to the definitions in
these interface libraries.
<p>
If the new functionality is independent of the compilation target, the
implementation of that functionality appears directly in the <code>.cpp</code>
files of the interface library.  On the other hand, if the new
functionality depends upon the particulars of the compilation target,
each target library (e.g., the <code>alpha</code> or <code>x86</code> library) includes
code to provide the appropriate functionality.
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-newinstr">[-&gt;]</a> provides examples of both kinds.
<p>
If the compiler system implementing the OPI targets only a single
machine, the single target library may directly specify the
implementation of these target-dependent classes and functions.  In a
compiler like Machine SUIF, we support multiple different targets, and
thus the connection of the multiple target-dependent classes and
functions to the OPI interfaces is a bit more tricky.
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-contexts">[-&gt;]</a> describes how this connection is
accomplished.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc5>New Operand Kinds</a></h2>
<a name="sec-newopnd"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
Since operands are a key component of any machine-level IR, one would
expect that the addition of a new kind of operand would require the
generation of new data structures in the underlying substrate.  In
general, this is true, and in a moment, we provide an outline of what
is involved in this tedious process.  We do not however provide a
lengthy explanation since we do not believe that this is something
that a large percentage of our users will want to do.  The OPI,
especially under Machine SUIF, already comes with a fairly extensive
set of atomic operand kinds.
<p>
On the other hand, we do see a need for our users to be able to define
new kinds of address expressions, and thus most of this section
describes a pair of simple mechanisms for supporting new
address-expression operands.  Extending the OPI to support these new
address expressions is straightforward and does not require any
knowledge of the underlying substrate.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc6>Substrate extensions.</a></h5>
<p>
In general, the way you would add new operand kinds to the OPI depends
greatly upon the underlying substrate and the implementation of the
<code>Opnd</code> class.  In Machine SUIF, the class <code>Opnd</code> simply wraps a
pointer to an object of the SUIF class <code>IrOpnd</code>.  To define a new
kind of operand, you would write a hoof specification for a new
operand class derived from the abstract class <code>IrOpnd</code>, as is done
for all of the atomic operand kinds currently available.
(Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#app-hoof">[-&gt;]</a> discusses hoof and its relationship to SUIF.)
You would then provide OPI functions to create, identify, and access
the components of this new class.  If instances of this class were
immutable, you would want to implement an OPI class like
<code>AddrExpOpnd</code>, which is a derived class of <code>Opnd</code>.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc7>New address expressions.</a></h5>
<p>
Aw we stated in <em>The OPI User's Guide</em>&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibopiuser">bibopiuser</a>]</b>,
address-expression operands are implemented as specializations of the
base class <code>AddrExpOpnd</code>, which is itself a derived class of
<code>Opnd</code>.  If you so desired, you could implement a new kind of
address expression simply by constructing an instance of the base
<a name="NWD2">class </a><code>AddrExpOpnd</code> and using its sequence methods to inspect and
manipulate the suboperands of your new address expression.  We do not
however recommend this approach.
<p>
Instead, we recommend that you derive a subclass of <code>AddrExpOpnd</code>
and define public methods in this subclass that provide more
descriptive names for the suboperands.  The class <code>BaseDispOpnd</code>
is an example of this approach.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-SyK7s-1" href="#NWD2"><dfn>&lt;class <code>BaseDispOpnd</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
class BaseDispOpnd : public AddrExpOpnd {
  public:
    BaseDispOpnd(Opnd base, Opnd disp, TypeId deref_type = 0);
    BaseDispOpnd(const Opnd&amp;);
    BaseDispOpnd(Opnd&amp;);

    Opnd get_base() const;
    void set_base(Opnd);
    Opnd get_disp() const;
    void set_disp(Opnd);
};

bool is_base_disp(Opnd);
</pre><p>

<code>BaseDispOpnd</code> defines an address expression with exactly two
suboperands: the register or variable-symbol base and the integer
immediate displacement.  The only other declaration that you need to
add to the OPI to begin programming with this new operand kind is the
prototype for the predicate function <code>is_base_disp</code>.  This OPI
function distinguishes base-plus-displacement operands from the other
kinds of operands in the OPI.
<p>
Notice that the class <code>BaseDispOpnd</code> does not add any new storage.
All of the necessary storage for this address expression is provided
<a name="NWD3">by the base class </a><code>AddrExpOpnd</code>, which gets its storage from the
SUIF class <code>OpndAddrExp</code> via the creator function <code>opnd_addr_exp</code>.
You don't have to understand exactly how this storage is allocated to
build a new operand kind like <code>BaseDispOpnd</code>.  Just understand that
the <code>src</code> sequence in <code>AddrExpOpnd</code> provides the storage for your
custom class, and that your custom class hides how (in this case)
<code>base</code> and <code>disp</code> map onto the suboperands of an instance of
<code>AddrExpOpnd</code>.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-1qJwBm-1" href="#NWD3"><dfn>&lt;<code>BaseDispOpnd</code> implementation&gt;=</dfn></a>
bool
is_base_disp(Opnd opnd)
{
    return get_kind(opnd) == opnd::BASE_DISP;
}

BaseDispOpnd::BaseDispOpnd(Opnd base, Opnd disp, TypeId deref_type = 0)
    : AddrExpOpnd(opnd::BASE_DISP, deref_type)
{
    set_src(0, base);
    set_src(1, disp);
}

BaseDispOpnd::BaseDispOpnd(const Opnd &amp;opnd) :
    AddrExpOpnd(is_base_disp(opnd) ? opnd : opnd_null())
{ }

BaseDispOpnd::BaseDispOpnd(Opnd &amp;opnd) :
    AddrExpOpnd(is_base_disp(opnd) ? opnd : opnd_null())
{ }

Opnd
BaseDispOpnd::get_base() const
{
    return get_src(0);
}

void
BaseDispOpnd::set_base(Opnd opnd)
{
    set_src(0, opnd);
}

Opnd
BaseDispOpnd::get_disp() const
{
    return get_src(1);
}

void
BaseDispOpnd::set_disp(Opnd opnd)
{
    set_src(1, opnd);
}
</pre><p>

Because we do not define any new storage when declaring a new
specialization of <code>AddrExpOpnd</code> and an <code>AddrExpOpnd</code> is the exact
same size as an <code>Opnd</code>, we can pass around or store an instance of
<code>BaseDispOpnd</code> (or any other specialization of <code>AddrExpOpnd</code>) as
an <code>Opnd</code>.  This invariant is important because OPI functions like
<code>set_src(Instr *mi, int pos, Opnd o)</code>, which replace the source
operand at location <code>pos</code> in an instruction's source operand
sequence with the operand <code>o</code>, do not have a variant that takes a
<code>BaseDispOpnd</code>.  We provide (and need) only a variant that takes an
<code>Opnd</code>.  You don't have to change any existing OPI functions
involving operands when you add a new operand kind.
<p>
This storage constraint invariant also enables us to provide trivial
constructors from an <code>Opnd</code> to a <code>BaseDispOpnd</code>.  You should
provide similar constructors in your custom class.  The following
example shows why this is important.  Suppose you wanted to operate on
the 0th operand of an instruction <code>instr</code>, but only if it were a
base-plus-displacement address expression.  You could write code
something like the following:
<p>
<pre>
    Opnd opnd = get_src(instr, 0);
    if (BaseDispOpnd bdo = opnd) {
        Opnd base = bdo.get_base();
        // ...
    }
</pre>

This code works because you can build a <code>BaseDispOpnd</code> from
an <code>Opnd</code> if the original operand was actually of type
<code>BaseDispOpnd</code>.  If not, the copy constructor returns a
null operand.  A null operand, if evaluated in a Boolean
context, evaluates to false.  All other operands evaluate
true.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc8>Custom Notes</a></h2>
<a name="sec-newnote"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
If you want to add a new annotation to the OPI, you should first check
to see if the value sequence associated with an existing annotation
satisfies your needs.  For example, if you need a new kind of flag
annotation, you simply define a new <code>NoteKey</code> and use the existing
creator function <code>note_flag</code>.  Similarly, you can simply use the
value sequence produced by <code>OneNote&lt;ValueType&gt;</code> or
<code><a name="NWD4">ListNote&lt;ValueType&gt;</a></code> for new singleton or list annotations.
<p>
Life gets more interesting if you want to define a new kind of custom
annotation, but not all that much more difficult.  In fact, the steps
involved in the design of a new custom annotation exactly parallel the
steps involved in the design of a new address-expression operand
(presented in the previous section).  The class <code>LineNote</code> serves
as an example.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-302t0R-1" href="#NWD4"><dfn>&lt;class <code>LineNote</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
class LineNote : public Note {
 public:
    LineNote() : Note(note_list_any()) { }
    LineNote(const LineNote &amp;other) : Note(other) { }
    LineNote(const Note &amp;note) : Note(note) { }

    int get_line() const        { return _get_c_long(0); }
    void set_line(int line)     { _replace(0, line); }
    IdString get_file() const   { return _get_string(1); }
    void set_file(IdString file){ _replace(1, file); }
};
</pre><p>

<code>LineNote</code> is a derived class of <code>Note</code>, and as in the case with
derived classes of <code>Opnd</code>, the custom classes of <code>Note</code> do not add
any new storage.  They get all of the storage they need from the base
class.  This allows us to use the type <code>Note</code> for IR components of a
more derived type; we do not have to extend any existing OPI functions
involving the class <code>Note</code> when adding a new custom class.  And, it
makes the definition of copy constructors from IR components of type
<code>Note</code> trivial, as shown in <code><a href="#NWD4"><i>&lt;class <code>LineNote</code>&gt;</i></a></code>.
<p>
The underlying storage for the base class is provided by the function
<code>note_list_any</code>.  This function is used only by extenders; it should
never appear in the code for analyses or optimizations.  This function
produces a special kind of list annotation with a potentially
heterogenous value sequence.  In particular, each value in the
sequence can be one of the following types: <code>long</code>, <code>Integer</code>,
<code>IdString</code>, or <code>IrObject*</code>.
<p>
As in the case of a new address-expression operand, we define methods
of the new custom annotation class that reflect the meaning of each
sequence value.  The base class <code>Note</code> provides protected sequence
methods that allow you to inspect and change individual values as well
as manipulate the sequence itself.  In the <code>LineNote</code> example above,
we have defined two sequence values: a line value of type <code>int</code> and
a file name value of type <code>IdString</code>.  The line value happens to
occupy the 0th location of the value sequence, and it is accessed
using the protected method <code>Note::_get_c_long</code>.  We use this
particular method because we know the type of the value stored in the
0th location.  We can make similar statements about the file name
value and methods.  Please see <em>The OPI User's
Guide</em>&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibopiuser">bibopiuser</a>]</b> for a discussion of how to program with
custom annotations.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc9>Substrate extensions.</a></h5>
<p>
You can also add new kinds of annotations by creating new data
structures in the underlying substrate.  As with operands, we do not
expect that you'll need to do this very often (if at all).  If you do
need something that cannot be satisfied with custom annotations, we
suggest that you review the documentation that came with your
<code>machine</code> library.  It will explain how the base class <code>Note</code> was
constructed on top of the substrate data structures.  You can use this
as a model for your new kind of annotation.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc10>New Instructions</a></h2>
<a name="sec-newinstr"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
All machine instructions are of type <code>Instr*</code>.  In the OPI, we
carefully hide the implementation of the <code>Instr</code> class so that
analyses and optimizations written using the OPI are not dependent
upon any particular implementation of it.  As we have stated
previously, this means that you can completely change the
implementation of the class <code>Instr</code>, and as long as your new
implementation adheres to the OPI, you will not have to rewrite any
existing optimizations.  This organization provides you with a lot of
freedom; you can completely restructure the <code>Instr</code> class since any
changes you make are hidden behind the OPI's functional interface.
<p>
In general, there are two basic questions that you must ask when
considering support for a new kind of instruction:
<p>
<ol>

<li>Does the class <code>Instr</code> or any of its existing derived classes
contain enough of the right kinds of storage to act as the container
class for your new instruction kind?
<p>
<li>Will the identification or manipulation of an instance of your
new instruction kind require target-specific information?
<p>
</ol>

<h5><a name=toc11>Storage considerations.</a></h5>
<p>
To support a new instruction kind, some IR data structure in the
system must contain enough storage to describe all of the instruction
components.  This issue is obviously dependent upon the particular
implementation of the OPI that you're using.  For an implementation
like Machine SUIF, you will probably not need to make any changes to
<code>Instr</code> or its derived classes.  We provide just a few very general
derived classes; each of which is capable of describing a wide range
of instructions.
<p>
For example, the class <code>InstrAlm</code> <b>[</b>This class is not in the
OPI.  It is simply how we have currently chosen to implement the part
of the OPI that supports for instructions.<b>]</b>  is capable of describing
any arithmetic, logical, or memory instruction consisting of zero,
one, or more source (``argument'') or destination (``result'')
operands.  You can even use this class to implement support for an
architecture with predicated instructions.  You could choose to
implement a predicated add instruction by defining the first source
operand of every instruction as the input predicate.  Optimization
passes not concerned with the difference between the input predicate
and the rest of the source operands continue to use the sequence
functions <code>get_src</code> and <code>set_src</code>, while those specifically
tailored for predicated architectures could use a set of sequence
functions that treated the first source operand specially.
<p>
Once you have identified (or defined) an appropriate storage container
for your new instruction kind, you next must provide a way for the OPI
user to create new instances of your instruction kind.  We refer to
functions in the OPI that create new instances of objects as
``creation functions'', or simply <em>creators</em>.  A machine
instruction creator takes an opcode and possibly some operands or
other instruction components, and it produces a machine instruction.
<p>
Continuing with our predication example, if you choose to use the
<code>InstrAlm</code> class as your storage for predicated instructions, you
could simply use the existing <code>new_instr_alm</code> creator functions for
your new instruction kind.  For convenience, you may decide to
implement a new creator function that distinguishes the input
predicate from the rest of the source operands.  The following
illustrates one possible way to do this:
<p>
<pre>
    Instr*
    new_instr_predicated_alm(Opnd dst, int opcode, Opnd predicate,
                             Opnd src1, Opnd src2)
    {
        Instr *mi;
        mi = new_instr_alm(dst, opcode, predicate, src1);
        set_src(mi, 2, src2);
        return mi;
    }
</pre>

For more information about support for machine instructions and
instruction creators, we refer you to <em>The Machine-SUIF Machine
Library</em> document&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibmachine">bibmachine</a>]</b>.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc12>Target dependence.</a></h5>
<p>
Once you have a data structure capable of describing your new
instruction kind and a mechanism to create an instance, you need to
define OPI functions to inspect and potentially manipulate the
instruction's components.  Often, you can reuse existing OPI functions
for this purpose, as we did above in our discussion of instruction
creators.  The new issue that we want to raise here is one of
target dependence.  This issue is best illustrated using a simple
<a name="NWD5">example from Machine SUIF.</a>
<p>
The OPI provides instruction predicates--Boolean functions that
return true if an instruction is a particular kind of instruction.
The functions <code>is_mbr</code> and <code>is_cmove</code> are two example predicates.
The former identifies multi-way branches, while the latter identifies
conditional moves.  Under Machine SUIF, the implementation of the
former is target independent, while the later is target dependent.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-1chgjL-1" href="#NWD5"><dfn>&lt;function <code>is_mbr</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
bool
is_mbr(Instr *instr)
{
    return has_note(instr, k_instr_mbr_tgts);
}

</pre><pre><a name="NW4A4imC-3R7e1j-1" href="#NW4A4imC-3R7e1j-1"><dfn>&lt;function <code>is_cmove</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
bool
is_cmove(Instr *instr)
{
    return dynamic_cast&lt;MachineContext*&gt;(the_context)-&gt;is_cmove(instr);
}

</pre><p>

The function <code>is_mbr</code> determines whether an instruction is a multi-way
branch by testing for the existence of an annotation that appears only
on multi-way branches.  In Machine SUIF, this annotation must appear
on all multi-way branches and is independent of the target.
<p>
The function <code>is_cmove</code> returns true if the instruction is a
conditional move.  We explain the implementation of this function in
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-contexts">[-&gt;]</a>.  Here, we simply state that this function
looks up the correct implementation of this predicate in the target
<code>Context</code>, which was loaded based on the target annotation during
the call <code>focus(FileBlock*)</code> in <code>do_file_block</code> in the pass's file
<code>suif_pass.cpp</code>.
<p>
Other implementations of the OPI may handle these issues in a
different manner.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc13>New Execution Bodies</a></h2>
<a name="sec-newexobj"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
Every now and then, you may find that you need to extend the system
with a new kind of <code>AnyBody</code>.  An <code>AnyBody</code> is an
<code>IrObject</code> that can be used as the body of an <code>OptUnit</code>.  An
<code>InstrList</code> is an example of an <code>AnyBody</code>.  In this
section, we review the major steps involved in building a library for
a new kind of <code>AnyBody</code>.  In particular, we describe our
implementation of the <code>Cfg</code>, a derived class of <code>AnyBody</code>,
and the structure of the control-flow graph (CFG) library.
<p>
The file <code>cfg/cfg.h</code> lists all of the important header files in the
CFG library. <b>[</b>Please note that not all of the declarations in the
<code>cfg</code> header files are OPI-visible functions and data structures.<b>]</b> 
This is the header file that users of your new functionality include
in their analysis and optimization passes.  This section discusses the
implementation of the CFG library and not just in its OPI interface.
<p>
The following list briefly describes each of the header files included
in <code>cfg.h</code>.  For a detailed discussion of the contents of these
files, we refer you to the Machine-SUIF CFG library document.
<p>
<ul>

<li><code>cfg_ir.h</code> and <code>cfg_ir_factory.h</code> define new hoof-generated
(i.e., SUIF-substrate-specific) classes and other data
structures.  This is where class <code>Cfg</code> and <code>CfgNode</code>
are declared since they are extensions of data structures
in the SUIF substrate.
<p>
<li><code>graph.h</code> defines the set of OPI functions available for
creating, inspecting, and manipulating the graph that is
the CFG.
<p>
<li><code>node.h</code> defines the set of OPI functions available for
creating, inspecting, and manipulating a CFG node and its
edges and contents.
<p>
<li><code>util.h</code> contains a number of OPI helper functions that
do not fall neatly into either <code>graph.h</code> or <code>node.h</code>.
<p>
<li><code>init.h</code> lists the parts of the CFG library that you
must initialize before you can start using its facilities.
<p>
</ul>

To define a new <code>AnyBody</code>, you would create one or more
substrate classes and one or more creator functions, as done in
<code>cfg_ir.hoof</code>.  You would also write an appropriate set of
initialization routines as we have done in <code>init.h</code> and <code>init.cpp</code>
for the SUIF substrate.  The content of the remaining header files is
specific to the kind of <code>AnyBody</code> you define.  There is one
piece of these header files that is important to include in any
<code>AnyBody</code>, and that piece deals with the issue of conversion
from one <code>AnyBody</code> to another.
<p>
The CFG library provides a creator function <code>new_cfg</code> that takes an
<code>InstrList</code> and produces a <code>Cfg</code>.  The Machine Library defines a
function <code>to_instr_list</code> that takes an <code>AnyBody</code> and produces an
<code>InstrList</code>.  The class <code>AnyBody</code> is the base class for
<code>InstrList</code>, <code>Cfg</code>, and other new <code>OptUnit</code> body types.  It is
an abstract class defining the method <code>to_instr_list</code>, which we use
to implement the OPI function <code>to_instr_list</code>.  In plain English,
<code>InstrList</code> is the default form of an <code>OptUnit</code> body, and as such,
we make it easy for you to provide a pair of converters between the
new <code>AnyBody</code> and <code>InstrList</code>.
<p>
Given a pointer to the body of an <code>OptUnit</code>, you can dispatch based
on the type of the body by using the <code>is_a&lt;BodyType&gt;</code> template
predicate function, where <code>BodyType</code> is the derived type of the
<code>AnyBody</code> you are interested in.  For example, the following
code ensures that the body of an <code>OptUnit</code> is a <code>Cfg</code>.
<p>
<pre>
    OptUnit *unit;
    AnyBody *orig_body = get_body(unit);
    if (!is_a&lt;Cfg&gt;(orig_body)) {
        // conversion
        InstrList *instrlist = to_instr_list(orig_body);
        Cfg *cfg = new_cfg(instrlist);

        // replace original body with new cfg
        copy_notes(orig_body, cfg);
        set_body(unit, cfg);

        // clean up
        delete instrlist; delete orig_body;
    }
</pre>

In order for the code above to work within a Machine-SUIF pass, you
must have linked the pass with the library corresponding to the type
of the <code>orig_body</code> and called that library's initialization
function.  This approach is unacceptable for a system where a new
<code>AnyBody</code> may be defined and used long after an optimization pass is
written.  
<p>
As such, we define two converter passes with each kind of <code>AnyBody</code>
we define.  In the CFG library, we define a pass <code>il2cfg</code> that
converts <code>OptUnit</code> bodies in <code>InstrList</code> form to <code>Cfg</code> form, and
a pass <code>cfg2il</code> that performs the opposite conversion.  Each
optimization pass then simply verifies that the input <code>OptUnit</code> body
is in the expected form; it is the responsibility of the person
stringing the passes together to insert converter passes where
necessary.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc14>Target Libraries and the Context Object</a></h2>
<a name="sec-contexts"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
A <em>target library</em> implements all target-dependent OPI functions
and initializes all target-dependent OPI data structures.  The
<code>alpha</code> and <code>x86</code> libraries distributed with Machine SUIF are
examples of target libraries.  In some compilers, you specify the
target library when the compiler is compiled.  In Machine SUIF, the
target is not specified until the compiler is run.  Machine SUIF
dynamically loads the required target library when it runs.
<p>
This section briefly describes the structure of a target library and
the method by which we support the dynamic linking of target libraries
in Machine SUIF.  The key to this process is the <code>Context</code> data
structure.  In Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-x86-ppro">[-&gt;]</a>, we show how this data
structure also supports architectural investigations by allowing you
to reuse large portions of an existing target library and override
only those portions you need.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc15>Development of a target library</a></h3>
<p>
A target library contains <code>enum</code> definitions, target functions, and
target descriptions.  A target library also includes initialization
code that the underlying substrate calls before using any of the
target library's facilities (e.g., see the <code>init</code> modules in
the Machine-SUIF <code>alpha</code> library).
<p>
The most important <code>enum</code> is probably the opcode enumeration.  With
two exceptions, the opcode of a machine instruction is meaningful only
when interpreted with respect to a target machine.  The exceptions are
<code>opcode_null</code> and <code>opcode_label</code>, which are the opcodes used for
the target-independent null or label instructions, respectively.  The
first target-specific opcode number therefore has the value <i>2</i>.  The
particular numbers used for the target-specific opcodes are not
dictated by the target instruction set architecture; they are
arbitrarily assigned small integers, useful for accessing instruction
properties by table lookup.  The same integer that represents <code>mov</code>
in an <i>x</i>86 instruction may be used for <code>addq</code> in an Alpha
instruction.
<p>
For each target-dependent OPI function, a target library must
provide a function with the same prototype.  For example,
the OPI function
<p>
<pre>
    bool is_cmove(Instr*);
</pre>

is implemented for the Alpha platform by the <code>alpha</code> library
function
<p>
<pre>
    bool is_cmove_alpha(Instr*);
</pre>

Similarly, for each OPI class that encapsulates a piece of the target
description, the target library must provide a specialization of that
class.  For example, the <code>x86</code> library declares <code>RegInfoX86</code> as a
subclass of the OPI class <code>RegInfo</code>.  For a detailed description of
the purpose of the function <code>is_cmove</code> and the class <code>RegInfo</code>, we
refer you to <em>The Machine-SUIF Machine Library</em>
document&nbsp;<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bibmachine">bibmachine</a>]</b>.
<p>
As illustrated above, our naming convention appends the library name
to the end of an OPI function to obtain the name for that function's
target-dependent implementation and to the end of an OPI class to
obtain the name for that class's target-dependent specialization.
Machine SUIF however does not use these names to bind an OPI
definition to its target-specific implementation.  That is the task of
the <code>Context</code> object, as explained in the next section.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc16>The target context</a></h3>
<p>
A <em>context</em> gathers all the items that characterize the target
machine into one record.  The context data structure is a powerful
tool for OPI extenders.  OPI programmers, on the other hand, don't
directly access the context data structure.  It is constructed
automatically during the (non-OPI) call to <code>focus(FileBlock*)</code>.  OPI
programmers access target characteristics through global functions and
through the data structures that they return.  Function
<code>target_regs</code>, which returns a <code>RegInfo</code> pointer, is typical.  The
<code><a href="#NW4A4imC-3R7e1j-1"><i>&lt;function <code>is_cmove</code>&gt;</i></a></code> shown earlier is another example.
<p>
We begin with a description of how contexts work in a system like
Machine SUIF and thus how you use them to provide support for a new
target.  We then explain the reasons why we chose this
design.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc17>Building and working with <code>the_context</code>.</a></h5>
<p>
Let's begin with a look at the implementation of
<code><a href="#NW4A4imC-3R7e1j-1"><i>&lt;function <code>is_cmove</code>&gt;</i></a></code> in greater detail.
This function is declared and
defined in the <code>machine</code> library, the main interface library in
<a name="NWD6">Machine SUIF.  It dynamically casts the global variable</a>
<code>the_context</code> to <code>MachineContext*</code> and makes an <code>is_cmove</code>
method call.
<p>
Digging deeper, we see that the declared type of <code>the_context</code> is
<code>Context*</code>.  The class <code>Context</code>, however, is just an empty base
class, as shown below.  The key feature of this type is that it is
known to everyone, machine dependent and independent.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-nKzAs-1" href="#NWD6"><dfn>&lt;class <code>Context</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
class Context {
  public:
    Context() { }
    virtual ~Context() { }
};
</pre><p>

The <code>is_cmove</code> method is actually declared in a different <em>interface</em> class, called <code>MachineContext</code>.  (The <code>target_regs</code>
method is declared here too.)  Interface classes are declared in
interface libraries along with their OPI functions.  
<p>
It is important to note that interface classes are not subclasses of
<code>Context</code>.  Each interface class is simply a chunk of interface that
target libraries use when composing an actual context instance that is
right for the target in question.  The method of composition is
<a name="NWD7">multiple inheritance.  So while the declared type of </a><code>the_context</code>
is <code>Context*</code>, it points to an object whose class inherits not only
from <code>Context</code>, but also from several interface
classes. <b>[</b>Context-interface classes are named for the
libraries that define them: <code>MachineContext</code> is defined in the
<code>machine</code> library, <code>SuifVmContext</code> in the <code>suifvm</code> library, and
so on.<b>]</b>   The context object for the <code>alpha</code> library is declared as
follows:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-2kcr6e-1" href="#NWD7"><dfn>&lt;class <code>AlphaContext</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
class AlphaContext : public virtual Context,
                     public virtual MachineContextAlpha,
                     public virtual SuifVmContextAlpha
{ };

#endif /* ALPHA_CONTEXT_H */
</pre><p>

The actual interface classes used in the declaration of
<code>AlphaContext</code> are derived classes of the base interface classes
found in the interface libraries.  To reiterate, the <code>machine</code>
library is an interface library; the context interface that it defines
is <code>MachineContext</code>.  The <code>alpha</code> library is an implementation
library; the context class that it defines realizes a number of
context interfaces, including <code>MachineContext</code> (through the
derived class <code>MachineContextAlpha</code>). <b>[</b>The <code>suifvm</code> library is
exceptional; it plays both roles.  It introduces the
machine-independent <code>SuifVmContext</code>, but it also defines a concrete
context that is specific to the SUIFvm target.<b>]</b>   The implementation
of <code>MachineContextAlpha::is_cmove</code> simply invokes the target-specific
function <code>is_cmove_alpha</code>.
<p>
The <code>init.cpp</code> file in the target library contains the last piece of
this puzzle.  The library's initialization code takes responsibility
for generating the concrete-context pointer that gets stored in
<code>the_context</code> by registering a function in
<code>the_context_creator_registry</code> map.  For the <code>alpha</code> library, this
context-creator function invokes the <code>AlphaContext</code> constructor to
create a new concrete-context object.
<p>

<h5><a name=toc18>Multiple inheritance as an implementation technology.</a></h5>
<p>
So why not call the methods of <code>the_context</code> directly?  For one
thing, it's shorter to write calls on global functions, and these
things occur quite frequently.  More importantly, the context is not
needed in some optimization settings, such as run-time optimization.
So for portability, code written against the OPI should be almost
``context free''.  In other words, we use object-oriented techniques
to support the extensibility goals of Machine SUIF, but hide this
technology behind an OPI based largely on functions for portability.
<p>
Ok, but why are concrete contexts in Machine SUIF built using multiple
inheritance?  Because it allows more flexibility in combining
libraries than traditional linear inheritance.  To see why, consider
the following argument.  The interface libraries used by an
optimization pass are known statically.  Its author chooses only those
that the pass needs.  The target library used by the pass, however, is
chosen and linked dynamically, based on the target associated with the
file being compiled.  How then can there be enough agreement between
the context class known when the pass is compiled and the one
generated when the target-specific library is linked in?  If contexts
are derived linearly, then the statically-known class cannot (in
general) skip a level of derivation and still be compatible with the
dynamically-generated context object.
<p>
Multiple inheritance from independent context-interface classes, together
with dynamic casting based on run-time type information (RTTI), solves this
problem cleanly.  A target library creates a context that contains the
union of all the information needed by passes that will use it.  A given
pass then accesses only those parts of the context that concern it.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc19>Target Library Extension</a></h2>
<a name="sec-x86-ppro"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
Though it is not difficult to build a target library from scratch, you
don't want to do this for multiple different revisions of the same
instruction set architecture (ISA), and you certainly don't want to do
this for different implementations of the same ISA.  As such, we
provide you with the ability to refine an existing target library.
This approach is especially advantageous for experimenting with new
architectural features (e.g., new instructions or new register-file
properties).
<p>
This section describes the implementation of the <code>x86_ppro</code> target
library.  This library is a refinement of the <code>x86</code> target library;
it adds support for instructions defined in the Pentium and Pentium
Pro.  We begin with an illustration of how to extend the opcode
enumeration.  The new instructions require us to override the
implementations of the OPI functions <code>target_printer</code>, <code>is_cmove</code>,
and <code>target_code_gen</code> from the <code>x86</code> library.  We conclude with a
review of the library's initialization code.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc20><a name="NWD8">Opcode extensions</a></a></h3>
<p>
The Intel Pentium and Pentium Pro microprocessors add several new
instructions to the x86 ISA.  To extend the opcode enumeration defined
in the <code>x86</code> target library, we number the new opcodes starting from
one beyond the value of the C preprocessor variable
<code>LAST_X86_OPCODE</code>.  We define 47 new opcodes, of which
<code>WRMSR</code> is the last.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-zi7d2-1" href="#NWD8"><dfn>&lt;opcode <code>WRMSR</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
const int WRMSR    = LAST_X86_OPCODE + 47;

#undef LAST_X86_OPCODE
#define LAST_X86_OPCODE x86::WRMSR

</pre><p>

To allow for extensions of this extension library, we re-define
<code>LAST_X86_OPCODE</code> to the value of this constant.
<p>
The file <code>opcodes.cpp</code> extends two target-specific tables
<code>x86_opcode_names</code> and <code>x86_invert_table</code> that associate a string name
and the complementary branch condition (if any) with each opcode.
Since the Pentium Pro does not add any new conditional branches, the
function <code>init_x86_ppro_invert_table</code> sets each new table entry to
an invalid opcode value.  These routines are invoked in the
library initialization <code><a href="#NWDD"><i>&lt;function <code>init_x86_ppro</code>&gt;</i></a></code>.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc21>Extension contexts</a></h3>
<p>
The inclusion of the new instructions requires us to extend the
<code>x86</code> printer class, <code>PrinterX86</code>, and override the OPI function
<code>target_printer</code>.  Some of these instructions are conditional moves,
and thus we want to override the <code>x86</code> implementation of the OPI
function <code>is_cmove</code>.  Finally, we would like to take advantage of
the new floating-point compare operations that allow us to directly
<a name="NWD9">update the </a><code>eflags</code> register.  This means that we would like to
override the OPI function <code>target_code_gen</code> that provides us with a
code generator from SUIFvm instructions to instructions of the
target architecture.  The next subsection presents a recipe for
extending the target-description objects.  In this subsection, we show
how you can combine these extensions with pieces from the <code>x86</code>
library to produce an <code>X86PProContext</code> object that invokes the
appropriate OPI functions.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-3q6XgK-1" href="#NWD9"><dfn>&lt;class <code>X86PProContext</code>&gt;=</dfn></a> <b>(<a href="#NWDA">U-&gt;</a>)</b>
class X86PProContext : public virtual Context,
                       public virtual MachineContextX86PPro,
                       public virtual SuifVmContextX86PPro
{ };



#endif /* X86_PPRO_CONTEXT_H */
</pre><p>

<a name="NWDA">Like the </a><code>X86Context</code>, <code>X86PProContext</code> inherits from <code>Context</code>
and derived classes of <code>MachineContext</code> and <code>SuifVmContext</code>.  As
shown below, the derived classes are just specializations of the
<code>x86</code> versions of these interface classes.  The specializations
simply override the methods corresponding to the OPI functions that
we wish to override.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-3GBZk2-1" href="#NWDA"><dfn>&lt;class <code>MachineContextX86PPro</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
class MachineContextX86PPro : public MachineContextX86 {
  public:
    Printer* target_printer() const;

    bool is_cmove(Instr*) const;
};

<a name="NW4A4imC-3GBZk2-1-u1" href="#NWD9"><i>&lt;class <code>X86PProContext</code>&gt;</i></a>
</pre><pre><a name="NW4A4imC-1BCfsC-1" href="#NW4A4imC-1BCfsC-1"><dfn>&lt;class <code>SuifVmContextX86PPro</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
class SuifVmContextX86PPro : public SuifVmContextX86 {
  public:
    CodeGen* target_code_gen() const;
};

</pre><p>

<a name="NWDB">The implementations of the </a><code>target_printer</code> and <code>target_code_gen</code>
methods either build a new instance of a <code>PrinterX86PPro</code> or
<code>CodeGenX86PPro</code> object, respectively, or return cached versions
of the appropriate object.  The implementation of the <code>is_cmove</code>
method is shown below:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-3tf8xg-1" href="#NWDB"><dfn>&lt;<code>MachineContextX86PPro::is_cmove</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
bool
MachineContextX86PPro::is_cmove(Instr *mi) const
{
    return (is_cmove_x86_ppro(mi) || is_cmove_x86(mi));
}
</pre><p>

Notice that the implementation assumes that the target-specific
functions are independent.  The function <code>is_cmove_x86_ppro</code> does
not re-implement any of the functionality implemented by
<code>is_cmove_x86</code>; it identifies only those new instructions that are
conditional moves and relies on code in the <code>x86</code> library to deal
with previously-defined instructions.  As discussed next, we adhere to
this kind of an approach for extending even the most complicated of
target-specific objects.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc22>Extension of target-description objects</a></h3>
<p>
OPI functions like <code>target_printer</code> and <code>target_code_gen</code> return
pointers to class objects that describe or produce target-specific
<a name="NWDC">information.  Since all of these objects are extended in the same</a>
basic way, we focus on extensions of the <code>Printer</code> class here.  The
<code>x86_ppro</code> library also contains code demonstrating how you could
extend the <code>CodeGen</code> class.
<p>
All of the new <code>x86_ppro</code> instructions are classified as <code>alm</code>
instructions, and thus the class <code>PrinterX86PPro</code> simply has to
override the method <code>print_instr_alm</code> of <code>PrinterX86</code>.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-2wZMyq-1" href="#NWDC"><dfn>&lt;class <code>PrinterX86PPro</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
class PrinterX86PPro : public PrinterX86 {
  protected:
    virtual void print_instr_alm(Instr*);

  public:
    PrinterX86PPro();
};



#endif /* X86_PPRO_PRINTER_H */
</pre><p>

The constructor for this class extends target-specific table
<code>print_instr_table</code> with a pointer to the appropriate print method
for each new opcode.  The public method <code>print_instr_alm</code> first
checks to see if the opcode of the instruction to print is one of our
new opcodes or not.  If it is, we specify how to print the instruction
in the implementation of this method.  If it is not, the routine
<a name="NWDD">simply invokes the base class method </a><code>PrinterX86::print_instr_alm</code>.
<p>

<h3><a name=toc23>Library initialization</a></h3>
<p>
The module <code>init.cpp</code> contains the library initializations that the
underlying substrate must perform before it or any of the optimization
passes can use the <code>x86_ppro</code> target library's facilities.
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-3W5S6e-1" href="#NWDD"><dfn>&lt;function <code>init_x86_ppro</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
extern &quot;C&quot; void
init_x86_ppro(SuifEnv *suif_env)
{
    static bool init_done = false;

    if (init_done)
        return;
    init_done = true;

    init_machine(suif_env);
    init_suifvm(suif_env);
    init_x86(suif_env);

    k_x86_ppro = &quot;x86_ppro&quot;;

    // initializations for opcode-indexed tables
    init_x86_ppro_opcode_names();
    init_x86_ppro_invert_table();

    the_context_creator_registry[k_x86_ppro] = context_creator_x86_ppro;
}
</pre><p>

The <code>x86_ppro</code> library requires the <code>machine</code>, <code>suifvm</code>, and
<code>x86</code> libraries to be loaded.  The function <code>init_x86_ppro</code> then
initializes a string constant and a few of the opcode-indexed tables.
The target-description objects are not created until they are first
needed.  Finally, the context-creator function for the <code>x86_ppro</code>
context is registered with the system.  This function simply invokes
the constructor for <code>X86PProContext</code>.

<h2><a name=toc27>SUIF's Hoof Specification</a></h2>
<a name="app-hoof"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
The SUIF group at Stanford uses a notation called <em>hoof
specification</em> to describe the structure of the C++ classes that
represent the SUIF IR and the relationships between those classes.
The C++ IR data types are generated automatically from hoof
specifications.  Users learn what methods are created from the hoof
descriptions, and they program in terms of those methods.  To give you
a flavor, here is a partial excerpt from the <code>machine_ir.hoof</code>
specification in the <code>machsuif2/machine</code> directory:
<p>
<pre>
    abstract IrOpnd : SymbolTableObject {
        virtual int kind;
        virtual Type* reference type;
    };

    concrete OpndVar : IrOpnd {
        VariableSymbol* reference var;

      public:
        int   get_kind() const { return opnd::VAR; }
        Type* get_type() const { return _var-&gt;get_type(); }
    };
</pre>

This declares two hoof classes: <code>IrOpnd</code> and <code>OpndVar</code>.
<code>IrOpnd</code> is abstract in the C++ sense: it has no instances of its
own; rather, all of its instances are instances of subclasses.  It
also has no fields that are strictly its own, but it has two
``virtual'' fields: an integer defining the operand kind and a
reference to a <code>Type</code> object.  These virtual fields indicate that
the C++ class produced from this Hoof specification should contain
four virtual methods: <code>get_kind</code>, <code>set_kind</code>, <code>get_type</code>, and
<code>set_type</code>.  The implementation of these virtual methods is left to
the subclasses of <code>IrOpnd</code>.
<p>
<code>OpndVar</code> is a concrete subclass of <code>IrOpnd</code>.  In addition to the
fields defined by <code>IrOpnd</code>, <code>OpndVar</code> declares a field that refers
to a <code>VariableSymbol</code>.  This field consumes real storage in an
instance of <code>OpndVar</code>.  This declaration also produces methods that
allow a user of an <code>OpndVar</code> object to get and set class variable
<code>var</code>.  Finally, the hoof specification of <code>OpndVar</code> specifies the
implementation of the virtual methods <code>get_kind</code> and <code>get_type</code>.
Since variable-symbol operands are atomic in the OPI, we do not need
to provide any implementations of the set methods.

<h2><a name=toc28>Header-File Inclusion and Library Initialization</a></h2>
<a name="app-include"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
When extending Machine SUIF, you may want to follow the conventions for
header-file inclusion and library initialization that we have used in
building the system.
<p>
The first guiding principle is that each source file should record its own
explicit dependences by <code>#include</code>-ing appropriate header files.  And it
should never have to cater for the dependences of files that it includes.
Similarly, each library or pass should call the initialization function for
any library that it depends on, and not rely on knowledge that one library
may initialize another.
<p>
A second principle is that the exports of a library should be encapsulated
in a single header file for the library, so that no client needs to be
aware of the internal structure of a library that it depends on.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc29>Library-exports header file.</a></h5>
<p>
For example, clients of the CFG library use this directive:
<p>
<pre>
#include &lt;cfg/cfg.h&gt;
</pre>

Note that we use angle brackets, rather than quotation marks, to delimit
the file path.  This is not essential, but it acts as a reminder that all
header files are installed under <code>$NCIHOME/include</code>, and it helps to
prevent ambiguities arising because different C++ implementations have
different rules for deciding where to search for headers included in
headers.
<p>
<a name="NWDE">The path for a library-exports header file always has the above form, i.e.,</a>
it uses the library name as both a directory and as the stem of the file
name.
<p>
A library header file contains only <code>#include</code> directives.  The header
files that they inject declare the exports of the library.  Take the header
file for the BVD library for example:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW4A4imC-3iFB3J-1" href="#NWDE"><dfn>&lt;contents of <code>bvd.h</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
#include &lt;bvd/flow_fun.h&gt;
#include &lt;bvd/catalog.h&gt;
#include &lt;bvd/solve.h&gt;
#include &lt;bvd/liveness.h&gt;
#include &lt;bvd/reaching_defs.h&gt;
#include &lt;bvd/init.h&gt;
</pre><p>

There's no need to include header files from other libraries (such as CFG)
in <code>bvd.h</code> because any such dependences are handled within the local
headers themselves.  (E.g., <code>solve.h</code> includes <code>cfg.h</code>.)
<p>
<h5><a name=toc30>Header inclusions in other source files.</a></h5>
<p>
Each <code>.h</code> and <code>.cpp</code> file implementing a library or pass <code>#include</code>s
all the header files that the compiler needs to see to compile it properly.
When it needs exports of (another) library, it includes the exports header
of that library, using the angle-bracket notation shown in the examples
above.  But a <code>.cpp</code> file within a library never includes that library's
own exports header.  Instead it includes just the local headers that it
needs, using the <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> notation and the directory qualifier, just like
in the <code>.h</code> files.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc31>Library initialization.</a></h5>
<p>
The rule for deciding which library initialization routines (those named
<code>init_</code><em>library</em>) to invoke when initializing a library or pass
parallels the rule for header-file inclusion.  If there's a need to
explicitly <code>#include</code> the exports header of a library, then you should
explicitly invoke its <code>init_</code><em>library</em> routine, and otherwise not.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc32>Link specification.</a></h5>
<p>
It would be nice if the library search list submitted to the linker,
represented in a <code>Makefile</code> by using a <code>LIBS</code> definition, could exactly
parallel the other explicit mentions of a library.  Implementing that seems
more trouble than it's worth, however.  So we just let the linker tell us
via error messages what implicitly-required libraries to include in each
<code>LIBS</code> list.
<p>
<h5><a name=toc33>Substrate-boundary library.</a></h5>
<p>
The <code>machine</code> library is special in that it serves as a boundary layer
between Machine SUIF and the base SUIF substrate.  In general, all
dependences on base SUIF are captured in <code>machine/machine.h</code> and in an
additional header file called <code>machine/pass.h</code> that each pass should
include in its ``SUIF wrapper'' implementation files.  Likewise, the
<code>init_machine</code> function that sets up the <code>machine</code> library also takes
care of initializing libraries imported from base SUIF.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc34>More Naming Conventions</a></h2>
<a name="app-naming-conventions"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
The <em>OPI User's Guide</em> describes the conventions used in forming OPI
identifiers.  The Machine SUIF implementation observes those conventions,
and it adds some that did not come up in specifying the OPI.
<p>
When you extend the system, you often need to make up new enumeration
identifiers.  New opcodes, new architectural registers, and new kinds of
instrumentation all call for new enumeration symbols.  For these symbols,
which may have wide visibility and get a lot of use, we use upper-case
identifiers, articulated with underscores.  To avoid name collisions, we
limited use of C++ namespaces, and we use the name of the current library
to name such namespaces themselves.
<p>
For example, the enumeration literals for opcodes in the Alpha architecture
have names like <code>ADDQ</code> and <code>MOV</code>, and they are defined in namespace
<code>alpha</code>.  In code that uses the Alpha library, the programmer can choose
to qualify names explcitly, as in <code>alpha::MOV</code>, or to open the namespace
with directive
<p>
<pre>
   using namespace alpha;
</pre>

<a name="NWDF">This is not to say that we put every enumeration type definition into a</a>
namespace.  Where local constant names seem helpful for the clarity of the
code, we use ordinary <code>const</code> or <code>enum</code> declarations.  We usually
follow the long-standing C convention of upper-case symbols to distinguish
constants from variables.
