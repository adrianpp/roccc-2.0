<h2><a name=toc2>Abstract</a></h2><blockquote>

The Machine SUIF static single-assignment library translates an
optimization unit into or out of static single-assignment form (SSA), a
constrained representation that supports many kinds of analysis and
optimization.  Conversion to SSA form produces an object of class
<code>SsaCfg</code> that holds information about the transformed code, including
both data-flow information for use during optimization and the maps needed
to return the code to conventional form.
<p>
Our implementation follows the design described by Briggs <em>et al</em>
<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-paper">bib-rice-paper</a>]</b> at Rice University.  Their approach is flexible,
allowing users to control the space/speed tradeoff.  It also deals
carefully with correctness and efficiency issues that arose in previous
implementations.
<p>
This document describes how to use the SSA library, and it makes
connections to the paper <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-paper">bib-rice-paper</a>]</b> and the implementation

<h2><a name=toc3>Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Static single-assignment form scarely needs an introduction.  In the
relatively few years since its invention, it has become a popular
representation for use in data-flow analysis and optimization.  It is so
robust and useful that the entire global optimization phase of the SGI
Pro64 compiler is carried out in SSA form.
<p>
The Massively Scalar Compiler Project at Rice University, headed by Keith
Cooper, has developed many optimizations based on SSA form.  They have
studied the issues in implementing the translation to and from SSA
representation.  Their findings are published in a journal article
<b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-paper">bib-rice-paper</a>]</b> and a detailed account, in ``literate programming''
style, of their implementation <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-code">bib-rice-code</a>]</b>.  Both of these
documents are available online.
<p>
Rice's design provides flexibility by allowing users to choose speed or
space efficiency and to control whether to optimize during transformation
and whether to retain data-flow information.  It also addresses tricky
correctness problems that arise when translating SSA code back to
conventional, executable form.  In general, that translation requires
insertion of copy instructions to retain program semantics, and the Rice
work shows how to minimize the number of copies used.
<p>
The Machine SUIF SSA library is based on the Rice design.  In fact, the
first draft of the code was written at Rice by a Todd Waterman, a student
in Keith Cooper's group.  For consistency with Machine SUIF conventions, we
have reshaped the code and renamed some of the concepts, but we have
retained the basic functionality and the efficient algorithms developed at
Rice.
<p>
This document describes how to use the SSA library, but it is meant neither
as an introduction to SSA-based optimization nor as a detailed rationale
for the Rice approach.  Any of several recent compiler textbooks can
provide the former <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-appel">bib-appel</a>, <a href="#NWcite-bib-morgan">bib-morgan</a>, <a href="#NWcite-bib-muchnick">bib-muchnick</a>]</b>.  For the
latter, read the Rice paper <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-paper">bib-rice-paper</a>]</b> and the Rice code
description <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-code">bib-rice-code</a>]</b>.
 <b>[</b>We need to mention both of Rice's documents frequently. For
brevity, we'll refer to the published paper <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-paper">bib-rice-paper</a>]</b> as the
``Rice paper'' and to the implementation document <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-code">bib-rice-code</a>]</b> as
the ``Rice code''.<b>]</b> 
In the sections that follow, we point out connections between our
implementation and theirs, and we also identify things that we've done
differently.

<p>

<h2><a name=toc4>Terminology</a></h2>
<a name="sec-terminology"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
We begin by establishing a vocabulary.  Where possible, we use the same
terminology used by Rice, which in turn reflects the SSA literatire for
the most part.  In some cases, however, we found conflicts with Machine
SUIF conventions or customary usage too confusing, so we have made some
changes.
<p>
We're careful in our use of the related terms <em>name</em>,
<em>location</em>, and <em>value</em>.  In non-SSA code, a name represents
the contents of a storage location, but for any particular use of the
name, we usually can't say which definition filled the location and thus
gave the name its value.  In SSA code, a name represents the value
generated at a single definition point.
 <b>[</b>Rice uses the term ``resource'' instead of ``location''.  Where
we say `value', they often say ``definition'' or ``def''.<b>]</b> 
<p>
We say that an ``old name'', one that occurs in non-SSA code, stands
for a location, while a ``new name'', one in SSA code, stands for a
value.  In Machine SUIF, both kinds of names are represented as
operands, i.e., they have type <code>Opnd</code>.  The old names can be
variable-symbol operands or register operands; these are the items SSA
conversion pays attention to.  The new names inserted by conversion to
SSA form are always virtual registers, distinct from any that were in
the original code.
<p>
In Rice's implementation, operands, and therefore names, in the sense
above, are represented as integers.  That's very handy for looking up
operand attributes in tables.  Our names are operands, but we provide a
map from these names to small-integer ``identifiers'', or ``ID''s.
<p>
A singular feature of SSA form is the <em><i><b>phi</b></i>-function</em>, the fictitious
statement that defines a new SSA value by multiplexing different values of
the same original variable, each corresponding to a different incoming
control edge.  The Rice paper, like most other literature, calls these
``<i><b>phi</b></i>-functions'', but the Rice code uses <em><i><b>phi</b></i>-node</em>,
 <b>[</b>Maybe ``node'' refers to an element of the internal representation
of the program, or maybe it just means ``list element'', since a basic
block may in general have a list of <i><b>phi</b></i>-functions.  This latter use of
``node'' occurs repeatedly in the Rice code.<b>]</b> 
and we keep that term.  We use the word <em>sources</em> to describe the
inputs of a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node, since these ``argument'' values are analogous to
the source operands of an instruction.
 <b>[</b>The Rice code uses ``parameter'', abbreviated <code>parm</code>.<b>]</b> 
One or more of the sources of a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node may be <em>null</em>.  That means
that the underlying location has no definition along the incoming edge that
corresponds to the source.  A <i><b>phi</b></i>-node whose sources are all the same,
ignoring nulls, is called a <em>useless</em> <i><b>phi</b></i>-node.
 <b>[</b>The Rice code defines <em>useless</em> more aggressively, but notes
that this may not be a good idea.  We found cases in which the Rice
definition caused to many <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes to be eliminated.<b>]</b> 
Useless <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes may optionally be eliminated during conversion to
SSA form.
<p>
Each use of a name is called an <em>occurrence</em> of that name.  In SSA
form, the sources of a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node are occurrences just like those in
instructions.   A definition point may be either an instruction or a
<i><b>phi</b></i>-node.  We use the term <em>operation</em> to cover both kinds of
defining construct.  An instance of class <code>Operation</code> is the handle of
either an instruction or a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node.
<p>
The Rice paper describes three approaches to inserting <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes, which
vary in the time and space required to implement them.  The <em>minimal</em>
approach is so named because it requires less time, but it may insert lots
of dead <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes, i.e., one that define names that aren't used.  The
<em>pruned</em> style corrects that flaw by using liveness analysis to avoid
inserting dead <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes.  It therefore saves space at compile time, but
at the cost of doing data-flow analysis that might not otherwise be needed.
<p>
One of Rice's innovations is a third approach that they call
<em>semi-pruned</em>.  It's based on the fact that many of the names in a
program being converted to SSA form are local to a single basic block.
They are compiler-generated temporaries that are never live across a
control-flow edge.  Therefore, they never require <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes.
Semi-pruned form uses this observation to avoid inserting many of the
<i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes that would be in minimal form without performing the liveness
analysis needed for fully pruned form.
<p>
Figure&nbsp;1.4 of the Rice code document illustrates the differences among the
three flavors of <i><b>phi</b></i>-node insertion, and the text accompanying that
figure talks about the settings in which each is most appropriate.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc5>Overview of the Library's Interface</a></h2>
<a name="sec-overview"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
SSA form is a replacement intermediate representation.  Class <code>SsaCfg</code> is
a subclass of <code>AnyBody</code>, which means that one of its instances can serve
as the body of an optimization unit, just like those of <code>InstrList</code> and
<code>Cfg</code>.
<p>
SSA form construction starts from an existing CFG, which remains embedded
in the <code>SsaCfg</code> object that results.  You access it using the function
<code>get_cfg</code>.  Conversion to SSA form changes the code, however, so that the
contents of the CFG no longer fully describe its semantics.  The old names
in the code are replaced by their new, SSA counterparts, but the
<i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes that define some of the new names aren't inserted explicitly
in the instruction stream.  Instead, each basic block in the CFG may have
an associated set of <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes.  The OPI includes functions that map
from blocks to <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes and vice versa.  In general, optimizations that
use SSA form need to be aware of the <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes and they must use these
OPI functions for dealing with them.
<p>
At the end of an SSA-based optimization pass, you can call the function
<code>restore</code> to convert back to conventional, non-SSA form, so that the code
in the CFG again expresses the full semantics of the unit being compiled.
At that point, you would normally also store the CFG as the body of the
unit (using <code>set_body</code>), and then discard the SSA object.  Alternatively,
you can leave the <code>SsaCfg</code> object as the body, for input to a later
SSA-based pass.
<p>
Every SSA (new) name corresponds to an original (old) name, and when
feasible, it's nice to restore the original names during conversion back
from SSA form.  That's the default behavior of the <code>restore</code> function.
But an SSA-based optimization may make this impossible.  Since mapping from
SSA values to original names is many-to-one, there's no guarantee in
general that every SSA-name occurrence falls at a point where the
corresponding original location happens to hold the right value.
(Figure&nbsp;1.5 of the Rice code shows a simple example.)  So <code>restore</code> takes
a flag telling it not to restore the old names, but instead to leave the
SSA names in the code.  This means that <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes have to be replaced by
copy instructions inserted in predecessor blocks.  The Rice group worked
hard to make this efficient, and we retain their methods, but quite a few
copy instructions may be inserted at this stage.  Fortunately, many of
these copies can usually be eliminated by later optimization passes.
<p>
SSA conversion can optionally develop and record use-def and def-use
chains, although since each use-def ``chain'' has exactly one element, we
don't call it a chain.  The OPI includes function for accessing this
data-flow information.
<p>
Other options at SSA construction time are to eliminate copy instructions
and useless <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes.  A copy instruction becomes unnecessary if
subsequent uses of its destination name are replaced by its source name.
If this is done, the copy can be dropped.  This is usually the right thing
to do, but not always, because it means that <code>restore</code> can't restore old
names.  A <em>useless</em> <i><b>phi</b></i>-node is one whose source operands are
identical.  Folding of useless <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes is always beneficial.
<p>
Sometimes, an optimization needs to introduce new names while the program
is in SSA form and possibly to replace occurrences of existing names with
the new ones.  There are OPI functions that you call to record such changes
in the SSA database.  By convention, your optimization pass first modifies
the code and related <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes, and then calls methods to reflect the
changes it has made.  For example, when you replace one use occurrence by
another, you call <code>record_use_swap</code> to update the internal records of
your <code>SsaCfg</code> object.  When you insert a completely new instruction or
<i><b>phi</b></i>-node, you call <code>record_def</code> to record the new definition and
<code>record_all_uses</code> to record the new use occurrences.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc6>Excerpts from An Example Pass</a></h2>
<a name="sec-example-pass"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
<a name="NWD2">An SSA-based optimization pass called </a><code>dcessa</code> is distributed with
Machine SUIF.  This is an implementation of the dead-code elimination
algorithm given in Robert Morgan's textbook <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-morgan">bib-morgan</a>]</b>.  Without
going into the details of the algorithm, we'll show how it makes use of the
SSA library.
<p>
The conversion of an optimization unit's CFG to SSA form is carried out
by these lines:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW3BLBW7-1oIppg-1" href="#NWD2"><dfn>&lt;Convert to semi-pruned SSA form&gt;=</dfn></a>
    using namespace ssa;

    unit_ssa = new_ssa_cfg(unit_cfg, cur_unit,
                           BUILD_SEMI_PRUNED_FORM | BUILD_DEF_USE_CHAINS |
                           PRINT_WARNINGS);
    if_debug(5) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;\nInitial SSA CFG:\n&quot;);
        fprint (stderr, unit_ssa);
    }
</pre><p>

The snippet above opens the <code>ssa</code> namespace so that SSA library tokens
like <code>BUILD_PRUNED_FORM</code> can be used without qualification.  Next it
creates the <code>SsaCfg</code> object that will be used throughout the pass, and it
immediately does the conversion by applying <code>build</code> to the unit's CFG.
In this case, we opt to retain use-def and def-use information because it's
needed for eliminating dead code.  We also choose semi-pruned form to avoid
the cost of doing liveness analysis.  The extra <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes that may
result because we avoided full pruning aren't ultimately detrimental
because at the end of this particular optimization, we can restore the
original names instead of having to insert copy instructions to realize
each <i><b>phi</b></i>-node.  (We also choose <em>not</em> to fold away copy
<a name="NWD3">instructions during </a><code>build</code>, because that would inhibit the restoration
of original names later.)  Finally, when in high-verbosity debugging mode,
we print the SSA representation on <code>stderr</code>.
<p>
Once the DCE pass has found an operation that must be preserved in the code
being optimized, it goes through the input operands of that operation and
marks the definition of each such operand as needing to be preserved
itself.  Here's the code that does this for one operand, called <code>opnd</code>:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW3BLBW7-2f9Xnz-1" href="#NWD3"><dfn>&lt;Mark necessary definition&gt;=</dfn></a>
        Operation def = get_unique_def(ssa, opnd);
        if (!def.is_null())
            dce-&gt;mark_necessary(def);
</pre><p>

Function <code>get_unique_def</code> takes the place of a use-def ``chain'';
i.e., it connects a use to its defining operation, which may either be a
<i><b><a name="NWD4">phi</a></b></i>-node or an instruction.  The snippet above first excludes operands
(like immediate values) that have no definition, and then it deals
separately with the two kinds of defining operations.
<p>
When applied to a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node, the DCE pass's <code>mark_necessary</code> function
uses the name-to-identifier map stored in the <code>SsaCfg</code> object to obtain
an integer ID uniquely associated with the name that the <i><b>phi</b></i>-node
defines:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW3BLBW7-5GqW0-1" href="#NWD4"><dfn>&lt;Mark necessary <code>operation</code>&gt;=</dfn></a>
    if (has_note(operation, k_necessary_operation))
        return;
    set_note(operation, k_necessary_operation, note_flag());
    worklist.push_back(operation);
</pre><p>

<a name="NWD5">In the above excerpt, the elements of </a><code>worklist</code> have class
<code>Operation</code>, so that each repesents a handle on either a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node or
and instruction.
<p>
Finally, here is the code that handles control dependences for a
known-necessary <code>operation</code> that has just been popped from the worklist:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW3BLBW7-2YCDmv-1" href="#NWD5"><dfn>&lt;Mark necessary CTIs&gt;=</dfn></a>
        mark_controlling_ctis(get_parent_node(operation));
</pre><p>

<a name="NWD6">The helper </a><code>mark_controlling_ctis</code> that's used above takes a basic block
and it makes sure that any control-transfer instruction (CTI) on which that
block is control-dependent gets marked as necessary, i.e., not to be
eliminated.  The overloaded function <code>get_parent_node</code> maps either a
<i><b>phi</b></i>-node or an instruction to its associated basic block.
<p>
Finally, at the end of the <code>dcessa</code> pass, we call <code>restore</code> to put
the code back in conventional executable form:
<p>
<pre><a name="NW3BLBW7-2QGp3z-1" href="#NWD6"><dfn>&lt;Restore conventional (non-SSA) form&gt;=</dfn></a>
    unit_cfg = restore(unit_ssa);
    set_body(unit, unit_cfg);

    delete unit_ssa;
</pre><p>

The <code>restore</code> function detaches the <code>Cfg</code> object from the <code>SsaCfg</code>
object and returns the former.  Otherwise, the subsequent <code>delete</code>
statement would delete them both.  We use <code>set_body</code> to make the CFG the
body of the current optimization unit, and then we discard the SSA variant
that it replaces.
<p>
In this example, we chose to revert to the original names of the program,
which is safe with DCE because its only effect is to eliminate unneeded
instructions, not to reorder the code or make substitutions.  You can tell
<code>restore</code> to retain the new names by passing it the Boolean argument
<code>true</code>.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc7><a name="NWD7">A Reference Guide to the Library's Interface</a></a></h2>
<a name="sec-reference-guide"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
This section briefly describes the part of the OPI that deals with SSA
representation.  We give the declarations of relevant functions and types,
followed by capsule summaries of their values and effects.
<p>

<p><pre><a name="NW3BLBW7-4GdIfU-1" href="#NWD7"><dfn>&lt;Transformation to and from SSA form&gt;=</dfn></a>
SsaCfg* new_ssa_cfg(Cfg*, OptUnit*, unsigned flags = 0);
Cfg* restore(SsaCfg*, bool not_old_names = false);
</pre><p>

Function <code>new_ssa_cfg</code> transforms a CFG to SSA form and returns a
<code>SsaCfg</code> object that embeds the modified CFG.  It takes the current
optimization unit as an argument to provide information about formal
parameters.  Acceptable values for its values flag argument are described
<a name="NWD8">just below.</a>
<p>
Function <code>restore</code> transforms back to conventional form.  It also
disconnects and returns the embedded CFG, so that the SSA object can be
reclaimed without affecting the CFG.  By default, it restores the original
names for SSA variables, but flag <code>not_old_names</code> causes it to keep the
SSA names.
<p>

<p><pre><a name="NW3BLBW7-3RXtPD-1" href="#NWD8"><dfn>&lt;Flags for SSA conversion&gt;=</dfn></a>

</pre><p>
The <code>flags</code> argument to <code>new_ssa_cfg</code> should be the bitwise union of
one or more of the above-defined tokens.  Note that these are in the
<code>ssa</code> namespace.  To use them, you can either qualify each with the prefix
<code>ssa::</code>, or you can open the namespace with a <code>using namespace</code>
declaration, as shown in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec-example-pass">[&lt;-]</a>.
<p>
<ul>

<li><code>BUILD_MINIMAL_FORM</code>, <code>BUILD_SEMI_PRUNED_FORM</code>, and
<code>BUILD_PRUNED_FORM</code> are mutually exclusive.  Minimal form ignores
liveness in placing <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes.  Pruned form only inserts <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes at
merge points where the defined value is known to be live.  Semi-pruned form
is a compromise that doesn't require full-blown liveness analysis.  It
places <i><b>phi</b></i>-nodes only for names known to be live on entry to <em>some</em>
basic block.

<li><code>BUILD_DEF_USE_CHAINS</code> directs the library to record def-use mappings,
which are available through the <code>get_use_chain</code> function (described below).
<p>

instructions involving SSA names by propagating the source of a copy to
the occurrences of its destination name.
<p>
<li><code><a name="NWD9">OMIT_USELESS_PHI_NODES</a></code> causes a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node to be omitted if every path to

Several functions simply report the inputs used to build SSA form.
<code>get_cfg</code> returns the embedded CFG.  The result of <code>has_minimal_form</code>
reflects whether <code>BUILD_MINIMAL_FORM</code> form has been constructed.
Similarly for <code>has_semi_pruned_form</code> and <code>has_pruned_form</code>.
Likewise, <code>has_use_def_chains</code>, <code>has_copies_folded</code>, and
<code>has_useless_phi_nodes_folded</code>, reflect the respective input flags.
<p>
The <code>get_loc_count</code> function returns the number of original names, while
<code>get_value_count</code> gives the number of SSA definitions, i.e., the number
of SSA values.
<p>
<code>get_value_catalog()</code> returns a map from SSA names to their integer
identifiers.  (The map is an <code>OpndCatalog</code>, which is defined in the
<code>machine</code> library and is typically used in data flow analysis.)  Function
<code>get_value_name</code> inverts the map: it returns the SSA name for a given
identifier.  And <code>get_def_block</code> returns the CFG node with which an SSA
<a name="NWDA">definition (instruction or </a><i><b>phi</b></i>-node) is associated.  (It returns
<code>NULL</code> if the definition is that of a useless <i><b>phi</b></i>-node that has been
eliminated.)
<p>
Finally, <code>get_unique_def</code> returns the defining operation for a name in
SSA form, and <code>get_def_use_chain</code> returns the list of operations
containing use occurrences of a name.

The <code>record_</code> functions are used to inform an <code>SsaCfg</code> object about
changes that you make in the SSA code.
<p>
Function <code>record_def</code> takes note of a new definition, in the form either
of an instruction or a <i><b>phi</b></i>-node.  It does not change the instruction or
<i><b>phi</b></i>-node, but looks there to find the SSA name defined.  You give it the
<code>old_name</code> so that it can later restore original names.  In the
instruction case, you also provide the position of the relevant destination
field in the instruction.
<p>
Function <code>record_use_swap</code> takes note of a replacement (<code>in</code> replacing
<code>out</code>) among the use occurrences of SSA names in an instruction or
<i><b>phi</b></i>-node.  It doesn't alter the instruction or <i><b>phi</b></i>-node; it just
updates internal records (e.g., def-use chains) to reflect the swap.  If
the name being swapped in is a newly-created SSA name, its definition must
<a name="NWDC">already have been processed by </a><code>record_def</code> before <code>record_use_swap</code> is
called.
<p>
Function <code>record_all_uses</code> takes note of all the use occurrences within a
new instruction or <i><b>phi</b></i>-node.  It modifies internal records (e.g.,
def-use chains) to reflect insertion of the instruction or <i><b>phi</b></i>-node into
the code.

<h2><a name=toc8>Adapter Passes</a></h2>
<p>
Machine SUIF includes simple passes for translating into and out of SSA
form.  <code>cfg2ssa</code> transforms a procedure already CFG form to SSA form.
<code>ssa2cfg</code> goes the other way.
<p>
The <code>cfg2ssa</code> pass take a command-line flag corresponding to each of the
flags accepted by <code>new_ssa_cfg</code>.  For example, <code>-build_minimal_form</code> on
the command line causes cfg2ssa to use the <code>BUILD_MINIMAL_FORM</code> flag when
creating a <code>SsaCfg</code> object.
<p>
The <code>ssa2cfg</code> pass takes an optional <code>-restore_orig_names</code>.  When
present, it causes original location names to be restored during conversion
from SSA form to conventional form.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc9>Summary</a></h2>
<a name="sec-summary"><b>[*]</b></a>
<p>
The Machine SUIF SSA library provides efficient conversion to and from SSA
form.  It lets you control the trade-off between speed and space
efficiency, and it gives you a number of options for performing
optimizations during the conversion and for exposing data-flow information
that it develops.  The implementation closely follows the design laid out
by Briggs <em>et al</em> <b>[cite&nbsp;<a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-paper">bib-rice-paper</a>, <a href="#NWcite-bib-rice-code">bib-rice-code</a>]</b>, which has
proven effective in a number of optimization studies.
<p>

<h2><a name=toc10>Acknowledgments</a></h2>
<p>
Our debt to the members of Keith Cooper's group at Rice University should
be clear.  Todd Waterman wrote the first version of the Machine SUIF
implementation while an undergraduate member of that group.  He used an
alpha release of Machine SUIF, and the system was heavily revamped before
its full release.  So at Harvard, Kathleen Durant reshaped Todd's code to
accommodate the changes in Machine SUIF and to conform with our more
conventional (less ``literate'') style of organization and documentation.
